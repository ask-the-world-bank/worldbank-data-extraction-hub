In 2016, roughly 40,000 Egyptians died of the disease, and nearly 4.5- 5 million are currently infected—the highest burden in the world for Egypt's population size. But the landscape has changed dramatically in the past few years. Following successful negotiations between the Egyptian government and drug makers in 2014, breakthrough medications known as direct-acting antiviralagents (DAAs) have become widely available at markedly reduced prices. Since then, more than a million Egyptians have been treated, with a cure rate exceeding 95 percent in many settings. Such rapid progress has brought Egypt growing international attention, with some predicting that Egypt's approach might serve as a model for other low and middle-income nations facing similarly large Hepatitis C burdens. In addition to lowering the cost of drugs, Egypt has succeeded in opening new treatment centers, creating electronic portals to enroll patients, and expanding its domestic pharmaceutical industry to ensure a steady pipeline of affordable medications.",Egypt's viral hepatitis program,Eliminating Hepatitis C from Egypt : 2017 update on current trends and policyrecommendations - policy brief,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/164381517333701631/pdf/123068-WP-P157533-PUBLIC-Eliminating-Hepatitis-C-from-Egypt-2017-Update.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/164381517333701631/text/123068-WP-P157533-PUBLIC-Eliminating-Hepatitis-C-from-Egypt-2017-Update.txt,/research/2018/01/29548131/eliminating-hepatitis-c-egypt-2017-update-current-trends-policyrecommendations-policy-brief,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/164381517333701631/Eliminating-Hepatitis-C-from-Egypt-2017-update-on-current-trends-and-policyrecommendations-policy-brief,2018/01/29548131/eliminating-hepatitis-c-egypt-2017-update-current-trends-policyrecommendations-policy-brief,164381517333701631,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/164381517333701631/Eliminating-Hepatitis-C-from-Egypt-2017-update-on-current-trends-and-policyrecommendations-policy-brief,D29548131,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tragically, an estimated 150,000 Egyptians are newly infected annually, and thousands die every year. In recognition of the enormity of the problem, in 2012, the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), in collaboration with stakeholders, developed the ""Plan of Action for the Prevention, Care & Treatment of Viral Hepatitis, Egypt"" (referred to in this report as the Viral Hepatitis Plan of Action), which focuses on the seven main components of viral hepatitis prevention and control: surveillance, infection control, blood safety, hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, care and treatment, communication, and research. The plan highlights the important goals and objectives of the MOHP's viral hepatitis program and reflects the MOHP's commitment to controlling the viral hepatitis epidemic by preventing new infections.

Yet, preventative measures are not implemented universally and high costs of medicines limits treatment efforts.

This also included effective policies and programs behind and supporting the movement. Such could be done for hepatitis, specifically using lessons from the HIV response.

The data thus support the cultural rather than the biological explanation for gender imbalance.",,Can biological factors like hepatitis B explain the bulk of gender imbalance in China? : a review of the evidence,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/723241468214800294/pdf/767840JRN0WBRO00Box374387B00PUBLIC0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/723241468214800294/text/767840JRN0WBRO00Box374387B00PUBLIC0.txt,/research/2008/05/17703000/can-biological-factors-like-hepatitis-b-explain-bulk-gender-imbalance-china-review-evidence,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/723241468214800294/Can-biological-factors-like-hepatitis-B-explain-the-bulk-of-gender-imbalance-in-China-a-review-of-the-evidence,2008/05/17703000/can-biological-factors-like-hepatitis-b-explain-bulk-gender-imbalance-china-review-evidence,723241468214800294,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/723241468214800294/Can-biological-factors-like-hepatitis-B-explain-the-bulk-of-gender-imbalance-in-China-a-review-of-the-evidence,D17703000,17,"Das Gupta,Monica",,,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A National Plan of Action for the Prevention, Care and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis was developed for 2014 to 2018, covering a comprehensive set of actions to control the epidemic of Hepatitis C. Those actions included the treatment of 500,000 CHC patients a year in addition to surveillance and prevention programs for a faster elimination of the virus reservoir and savings in long-term treatment costs. In 2016, MOHP has started its own program of treating patients using direct acting antivirals (DAA). According to the current estimates of the National Committee for the Control of Viral Hepatitis, at least 800,000 patients received treatment in 2016 (after 200,000 in 2015).

AIDS-related policies and programs in the Middle East and North Africa region are highly constrained by the lack of accurate information about the full scale of the epidemic. This is for a number of reasons, including limitations of existing surveillance, and intense stigma associated with the disease. Lebanon urgently requires greater understanding of its epidemic and high quality integrated bio-behavioral surveys of vulnerable populations are a prerequisite for greater understanding of low prevalence epidemics, such as Lebanon's. The costs of continuing to respond without adequate data or insight greatly outweigh the cost and complexities of such a survey. A Lebanese survey will also contribute to a greater regional understanding of the magnitude and dynamics of the Middle East's epidemics. The study aims to provide an estimate of HIV prevalence among four major vulnerable groups in Lebanon, namely men who have sex with men (MSM), prisoners, commercial sex workers (FSWs) and intravenous drug users (IDUs); provide an estimate of co-infection with Hepatitis B and C among HIV positive participants in the MSM population, FSW population, IVUDs, and the prisoners; provide an estimate of level of infection of Hepatitis C among the entire intravenous drug user population; foster research collaboration for the project between NGOs involved with the vulnerable groups, the National AIDS Program and the American University of Beirut and contribute to building the research capacity of the NGOs involved; estimate the population size of the four vulnerable groups using the multiplier method based on NGO sources and estimates; and gain greater insight into major HIV transmission dynamics among the four vulnerable groups in Lebanon.",,"Lebanon - Protocol for an integrated bio-behavioral surveillance study among most at-risk populations in Lebanon: Sex workers, injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, and prisoners",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/524551468051844433/pdf/700220ESW0P111027B00PUBLIC00P111408.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/524551468051844433/text/700220ESW0P111027B00PUBLIC00P111408.txt,/research/2008/11/16407915/lebanon-protocol-integrated-bio-behavioral-surveillance-study-among-most-at-risk-populations-lebanon-sex-workers-injecting-drug-users-men-sex-men-prisoners,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/524551468051844433/Lebanon-Protocol-for-an-integrated-bio-behavioral-surveillance-study-among-most-at-risk-populations-in-Lebanon-Sex-workers-injecting-drug-users-men-who-have-sex-with-men-and-prisoners,2008/11/16407915/lebanon-protocol-integrated-bio-behavioral-surveillance-study-among-most-at-risk-populations-lebanon-sex-workers-injecting-drug-users-men-sex-men-prisoners,524551468051844433,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/524551468051844433/Lebanon-Protocol-for-an-integrated-bio-behavioral-surveillance-study-among-most-at-risk-populations-in-Lebanon-Sex-workers-injecting-drug-users-men-who-have-sex-with-men-and-prisoners,D16407915,23,"Afifi,Rima","DeJong,Jocelyn",Health,,,"El Barbir,Farah","El Khoury,Danielle","Ghanem,Maguy","Kassak,Kassem","Kreidiyyeh,Khalil","Mahfoud,Ziyad","Ramia,Sami","Shamra,Sarah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Negligent clinical processes and infection protocols caused high rates of cross infection, with more than a third of dialysis recipients at risk of contracting a chronic viral disease such as Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, or HIV. Cross infections occurred when the blood of an infected individual encountered the blood of an uninfected individual. NephroPlus believed that it needed to become a role model to bring about the desired improvements in the industry. The company focused on identifying processes it could implement in its centers that would ultimately raise quality standards among all providers. The risks of cross infection, for example, could be drastically reduced through stringent clinical processes for hygiene. Yet service providers generally did not take necessary precautions and, in the absence of industry regulation, were not held accountable for negligence. NephroPlus engaged international nephrologists to introduce standardized clinical procedures across all their own centers to eliminate cross-infection. Having undergone lengthy treatment sessions, Shah knew that incremental changes to service delivery could go a long way toward making a dialysis patient’s life feel more normal. NephroPlus developed a care philosophy in which all patients were treated as guests (‘guest care’). Implementation of the idea entailed the creation of a comfortable dialysis experience with safe and painless treatment. The company also offered pick-up and drop-off transport service, to reduce dependence on family members, while dietary counseling and patient support groups promoted mental health.",IFC Case Studies : Health.,NephroPlus : A Personal Journey to Create Industry-wide Change - Making Dialysis Affordable and Accessible : Case Study,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/308761646708256200/pdf/NephroPlus-A-Personal-Journey-to-Create-Industry-wide-Change-Making-Dialysis-Affordable-and-Accessible-Case-Study.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/308761646708256200/text/NephroPlus-A-Personal-Journey-to-Create-Industry-wide-Change-Making-Dialysis-Affordable-and-Accessible-Case-Study.txt,/research/2016/09/33752055/nephroplus-personal-journey-create-industry-wide-change-making-dialysis-affordable-accessible-case-study,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/308761646708256200/NephroPlus-A-Personal-Journey-to-Create-Industry-wide-Change-Making-Dialysis-Affordable-and-Accessible-Case-Study,2016/09/33752055/NephroPlus-A-Personal-Journey-to-Create-Industry-wide-Change-Making-Dialysis-Affordable-and-Accessible-Case-Study,308761646708256200,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/308761646708256200/NephroPlus-A-Personal-Journey-to-Create-Industry-wide-Change-Making-Dialysis-Affordable-and-Accessible-Case-Study,D33752055,16,"Baptista,Piya","Mignano,Kathleen Gaertner",,,,"Holland,Madeleine Elizabeth","Shah, Kamal","Vuppala, Vikram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Request states that the Project’s Environmental and Social Management Plan and the Specific Contractual Engagement on Environmental and Social Management were violated. After receipt of the Request, the Panel conducted its initial due diligence and verified that the Request meets the admissibility criteria for registration. The Requesters explain that a complaint was submitted to World Bank staff on March 16, 2016, and that they are not satisfied with the Bank’s response.They described the indecent accommodations for workers; for example, shower facilities that were particularly unsuitable and completely different for local and foreign workers. The Requesters explained that workers who were found to suffer from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and hernia were dismissed from the site without support, along with workers who had suffered work-related accidents. As part of its due diligence, the Panel also met with Bank Management on December 15, 2017, to obtain information and seek clarifications. Management explained that the construction of the dam was completed, the dam was handed over to EDC and the contractor was in the process of demobilizing its workers. As provided in paragraph 17 of the IDA Resolution that established the Panel, the request was registered on December 22, 2017. As provided in paragraph 18 of the Resolution, and paragraphs 2 and 8 of the “Conclusions of the Board's Second Review of the Inspection Panel” (“the 1999 Clarification”), Bank Management must provide the Panel within 21 business days (by January 26, 2018) a response to the issues raised in the Request for Inspection. After receiving the Management Response, the Panel will, as outlined in the 1999 Clarification and as provided by paragraph 19 of the Resolution, “determine whether the Request meets the eligibility criteria set out in paragraphs 12 to 14 [of the Resolution] and shall make a recommendation to the Executive Directors as to whether the matter should be investigated.",,Cameroon - Lom Pangar Hydropower Project : request for Inspection,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/302851514921744073/pdf/Notice-of-Registration-12272017.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/302851514921744073/text/Notice-of-Registration-12272017.txt,/projects/documents/2017/12/29326520/cameroon-lom-pangar-hydropower-project-request-inspection,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/302851514921744073/Cameroon-Lom-Pangar-Hydropower-Project-request-for-Inspection,2017/12/29326520/cameroon-lom-pangar-hydropower-project-request-inspection,302851514921744073,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/302851514921744073/Cameroon-Lom-Pangar-Hydropower-Project-request-for-Inspection,D29326520,4,,,"Renewable Energy Hydro,Social Protection,Health,Public Administration - Energy and Extractives,Rural and Inter-Urban Roads",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunization resource tracking exercise in Tajikistan was largely an exploratory exercise to examine allocation and use of both donor and government resources for the national immunization program and immunization service delivery. Tajikistan was selected as the focus of this work for several reasons: a) Tajikistan has received significant external financing of immunization services from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) Alliance since 2001, and introduced new vaccines (Hepatitis B) in 2002.; b) immunization program performance, measured as the number of Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis vaccine (DTP3) doses provided, has not increased at commensurate levels as immunization financing; and, c) the start of a Health public expenditure tracking survey (PETS) was an opportunity to link immunization tracking to health resource tracking. The study had the benefit of seeing how results in immunization resource flows fit within those of the health sector. This case study represents one of the first systematic assessments of immunization resource flows at country level.",,Immunization resource tracking exercise : case study on the Republic of Tajikistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/697221468341062583/pdf/445100ESW0P0901Case0Study0June02008.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/697221468341062583/text/445100ESW0P0901Case0Study0June02008.txt,/research/2008/06/9625219/immunization-resource-tracking-exercise-case-study-republic-tajikistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/697221468341062583/Immunization-resource-tracking-exercise-case-study-on-the-Republic-of-Tajikistan,2008/06/9625219/Immunization-resource-tracking-exercise-case-study-on-the-Republic-of-Tajikistan,697221468341062583,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/697221468341062583/Immunization-resource-tracking-exercise-case-study-on-the-Republic-of-Tajikistan,D9625219,46,,,"Health,Non-compulsory health finance",Central Asia,,,,,,,,,,,Commonwealth of Independent States,Eastern Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of STIs worldwide are caused by eight infections: syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, genital herpes, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human papillomavirus (HPV). These infections, often silent and without symptoms, can result in serious or fatal health consequences. Cervical cancer, caused by HPV, is the largest single cause of years of life lost to cancer in the developing world and, because it affects women in their most productive years, has a devastating effect on the well-being of families. Syphilis among pregnant women still results in up to 1.5 million perinatal deaths each year. Damage to the fallopian tubes from gonorrhea and chlamydia can lead to infertility, as well as tubal pregnancy, an important cause of maternal death in developing countries. Hepatitis B, most frequently transmitted from mother-to-child in endemic areas, can result in chronic infection, liver cancer and liver failure. Genital herpes and other genital ulcer diseases increase risk of HIV transmission. STIs are among the world's most common diseases, with an annual incidence exceeded only by diarrheal diseases, malaria, and lower respiratory infections. The burden on the health care system and healthcare expenditure is great. STIs, even without including HIV, are consistently among the most common conditions leading to health care visits regardless of national resources. Due to their high prevalence, particularly in developing country settings, STIs result in substantial productivity losses for individuals and communities, particularly where the majority of the population is under 40 years of age. In developing country settings, STIs are among the leading causes of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost for women of reproductive age, exceeded only by maternal causes and HIV.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the status of the HIV epidemic among PWID in MENA by describing HIV prevalence and incidence. Secondary objectives were to describe the risk behavior environment and the HIV epidemic potential among PWID, and to estimate the prevalence of injecting drug use in MENA. This was a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines and covering 23 MENA countries. PubMed, Embase, regional and international databases, as well as country-level reports were searched up to December 16, 2013. Primary studies reporting (1) the prevalence/incidence of HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, or hepatitis C virus (HCV) among PWIDs; or (2) the prevalence of injecting or sexual risk behaviors, or HIV knowledge among PWID; or (3) the number/proportion of PWID in MENA countries, were eligible for inclusion. The quality, quantity, and geographic coverage of the data were assessed at country level. Risk of bias in predefined quality domains was described to assess the quality of available HIV prevalence measures. The study identified a large volume of HIV-related biological and behavioral data among PWID in the MENA region. The coverage and quality of the data varied between countries. There is robust evidence for HIV epidemics among PWID in multiple countries, most of which have emerged within the last decade and continue to grow. The lack of sufficient evidence in some MENA countries does not preclude the possibility of hidden epidemics among PWID in these settings. With the HIV epidemic among PWID in overall a relatively early phase, there is a window of opportunity for prevention that should not be missed through the provision of comprehensive programs, including scale-up of harm reduction services and expansion of surveillance systems.",Author accepted manuscript,HIV among people who inject drugs in the Middle East and North Africa : systematic review and data synthesis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/810451468179091968/pdf/102454-JRN-Box394835B-PUBLIC-HIV-among-People-Who-Inject-Drugs-in-the-Middle-East.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/810451468179091968/text/102454-JRN-Box394835B-PUBLIC-HIV-among-People-Who-Inject-Drugs-in-the-Middle-East.txt,/research/2014/06/25812769/hiv-among-people-inject-drugs-middle-east-north-africa-systematic-review-data-synthesis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/810451468179091968/HIV-among-people-who-inject-drugs-in-the-Middle-East-and-North-Africa-systematic-review-and-data-synthesis,2016/01/25812769/hiv-among-people-inject-drugs-middle-east-north-africa-systematic-review-data-synthesis,810451468179091968,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/810451468179091968/HIV-among-people-who-inject-drugs-in-the-Middle-East-and-North-Africa-systematic-review-and-data-synthesis,D25812769,30,Ghina R.

After reveiwing the existing literature on demand- and supply-side side factors that affect immunization programs, the authors find that the elements that most affect immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries involve broad changes in the global policy environment and contact with international agencies. Democracies tend to have lower coverage rates than autocracies, perhaps because bureaucratic elites have an affinity for immunization programs and are granted more autonomy in autocracies, althought this effect is not visible in low-income countries. The authors also find that the quality of a nation's institutions and its level of development are strongly related to immunization rate coverage and vaccine adoption, and that coverage rates are in general more a function of supply-side than demand effects. there is no evidence that epidemics or polio eradication campaigns affect immunization rates one way or another, or that average immunization rates increase following outbreaks of diphtheria, pertussis, or measles.","Policy, Research working paper series ; no.

The reforms on expanding public health service delivery or component B have exceeded projections and expectations with the country tripling its spending for vaccines by fully covering all eligible children with polio, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT), measles and hepatitis B vaccinations, and introducing measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and Hemophilus influenza B (HiB) vaccines in the county. The public health performance grants have also progressed. The reallocation of an additional $20,725,000 to component B is primarily to provide funding cover for the 2010 vaccines with $20,225,000 of the re-allocated amount to finance the vaccines. The funding for vaccines has increased from 6 million USD to 18 million USD brought about by the full coverage to all eligible children of polio, DPT, measles and Hepatitis B vaccines and expansion of the vaccine and the introduction of HiB and MMR vaccines. The $500,000 additional allocation to the performance-based public health awards is expected to support further scaling up of the said performance grants.

The scope of surveillance is broad, from early warning systems for rapid response in the case of communicable diseases to planned response in the case of non-communicable diseases, where the lag time between exposure and disease is longer than for communicable diseases. Most countries have laws or regulations on mandatory reporting of a list of conditions determined by each country, primarily communicable diseases such as childhood vaccine-preventable diseases (polio, measles, tetanus, and diphtheria), TB, hepatitis, meningitis, and leprosy. Relatively small investments can be very effective in reducing death, disease, and disability. Surveillance can make the health system more effective and efficient, and better able to control devastating epidemics. It can lead to early detection of local epidemics when control is more effective, less costly, and involves less loss of life. Surveillance is also important for controlling and preventing endemic diseases that reduce productivity and can be costly to manage. Good surveillance systems permit early identification of diseases such as TB and syphilis that can be cured easily with low-cost treatments, combined with other public health actions.","Public Health at a Glance,HNP notes",Surveillance,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/876061468324577254/pdf/536490BRI0FREN10Box345621B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/876061468324577254/text/536490BRI0FREN10Box345621B01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2006/05/11994146/surveillance,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/876061468324577254/Surveillance,2006/05/11994146/surveillance,876061468324577254,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/876061468324577254/Surveillance,D11994146,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is especially so far the poor families, which have no access to the centralized water and sewerage service system. The population growth, resulting from in-migration in Ulaanbaatar has resulted in the urbanization of poverty, generally concentrated in the Ger areas. This further deteriorated the hygiene and sanitation situation affecting the health of the population, especially children. The morbidity pattern reveals high rate of water-borne and poor environment related diseases, such as, diarrhea and hepatitis a, particularly among children. The city authorities of Ulaanbaatar in their effort to upgrade the living environment in the Ger areas have continuously searched for strategies and programs that can help improve the hygiene and sanitation practices. Various bilateral and multilateral agencies, in collaboration with national and local governments have tested different approaches to address the problem. Lessons learned indicate that the community-based demand-creation strategy appears to be most promising and appropriate especially in the Ger areas of the city. Specifically, this community dialogue tool kit provides the different illustrated materials as an accompanying set of Information education communication (IEC) to be used during the conduct of the community dialogue for the promotion of hygiene and sanitation. The guidelines on how to use the community dialogue tool kit is included in the manual on promotion of hygiene and sanitation.

There will be anticipated impacts, and mitigation measures. Disease Surveillance Laboratories carry out testing for infectious and contagious diseases, such as malaria, typhoid, cholera and hepatitis, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. These laboratories therefore generate waste which includes infected human tissues and blood samples, microbes, discarded chemicals, sharps, etc. Such waste, if not managed properly, carries the risk of infection for waste handlers and to the larger community, and is also a potential environmental hazard, through pollution of land, water and ground water. Although the amounts of waste generated from such laboratories is small, its varied and hazardous composition requires comprehensive management of the waste lifecycle, from source to disposal, to prevent adverse impacts on the environment and public health. Adequate waste management in laboratories will not only improve overall environmental performance but also facilitate in providing a safe workplace for the laboratory personnel. In addition, laboratories have to comply with the environmental regulations of the Government of India. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Laboratories will address safety and waste management issues. Under the project, operations manuals have already been prepared which focus on, among other technical topics, good laboratory practices, decontamination and Bio-safety issues. A waste management program will also be formulated to define the processes required for dissemination and implementation at laboratory levels and for monitoring. The SOP and waste management program will be finalized through a consultative process, involving the directors and operators of the national-owned and private laboratories to ensure a feasible and pragmatic program.",,India - Integrated Disease Surveillance Project : Environmental Assessment,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/850301468756561633/text/multi0page.txt,/projects/documents/2003/04/2335904/india-integrated-disease-surveillance-project-environmental-assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/850301468756561633/India-Integrated-Disease-Surveillance-Project-Environmental-Assessment,2003/04/2335904/india-integrated-disease-surveillance-project-environmental-assessment,850301468756561633,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/850301468756561633/India-Integrated-Disease-Surveillance-Project-Environmental-Assessment,D2335904,null,,,"Other industry,Health,Information technology,Sub-National Government,Central Government (Central Agencies)",Asia,,,,,,,,,,Risk management; Malaria; Typhoid; Cholera; Hepatitis viruses; HIV infections; Microbes; Chemicals; Waste management; Hazardous substances; Environmental hazards; Water pollutants; Safety issues; Health aspects of biological diversity; Public health surveillance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this perspective, the intervention strategy of the project will be underpinned by a number of measures which are most relevant including the need to: 1) Conduct training activities of various actors (healthcare, manipulators of DISS, municipal waste collectors, landfill managers, etc.); 2) Carry out campaigns of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) direction of the grassroots, direct beneficiaries of project activities and the challenges of environmentally sustainable management of DISS; 3) Strengthen the institutional and technical capacities in the direction of a consultation with government authorities to initiate the formulation of policy and regulations governing the GDISS, to allow executives to have organizational and appropriate management tools; and 4) Support partnership initiatives between public, private and the Preparedness Society in the collection and management of DISS. The problems caused by mismanagement of DISS are considerable: accidental injuries; risk of accidents for health personnel; accident risk for children playing on landfills; acute poisoning and infections. Regarding infections, three categories are identified: Viral diseases such as HIV / AIDS, Viral Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis. The project can also lead to a potential spread of diseases and chemical contaminants through the food chain.

China's infant mortality rate is among the very lowest in the developing world. The number of post-neonatal deaths as a proportion of total infant death has decreased to a level comparable to a developed country. The epidemiologic pattern of vaccine preventable diseases indicates that immunization activities have had a significant impact on the occurrence of these diseases. The overall prevalence of infectious diseases is decreasing and, relatively, the frequency of congenital defects is increasing as a major cause of childhood mortality. However, fecal-borne diseases such as dysentery, hepatitis, & ascariasis are still the predominant causes of morbidity. A secular improvement in the nutritional status of Chinese children is noted, but mild to moderate malnutrition still persists. This review looks at: the impact of the one-child family policy, which is creating different demands on the maternal & child health care service network; technological shortcomings in immunization activities, which are affecting coverage; the lack of better technical training, which is influencing health reporting & surveillance systems.",Staff working paper ; no.

The final disposition of these wastes might have an impact on surrounding natural resources, which , if they are not handled properly, can have negative effects. In the area of prevention, the only type of medical waste generated is in harm reduction programs for intravenous drug users which include needle exchange components. With regard to treatment and care, potential risk arises from unprotected handling of blood or body fluids of infected individuals (including HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and other STDs), and from wastes emanating from the treatment in health facilities and from laboratory work. In the case of clinical and biomedical research Group A wastes (biological wastes, like cultures and inoculations from clinical and research laboratories; contaminated blood products; surgical and pathological wastes; sharps; and secretions, excretions, and other organic liquids derived from patients and residues contaminated by those materials), may be generated , and possibly some of type B2 (pharmaceutical residue like dated medications, contaminated medications, and unused medications). To reduce potential risk, guidelines are developed for managing syringes in needle exchange programs. Bio-safety precautions will be used in handling blood, secretions and excretions, and in contact with mucus material and loose skin. Guidelines also specify how to dispose of solid healthcare waste, as well as the use of individual protection equipment. Staff will be trained on a regular basis.

Chile's experience illustrates the magnitude of this transformation. By the mid-1990s Chile's per capita income had reached about US$4,000 (adjusted for purchasing power), and Chilean women had achieved a life expectancy of 79 years. A century ago, in 1900, today's high-income countries also had income levels around $4,000-and, therefore, had resources sufficient to provide their populations with adequate food, water, shelter, and sanitation. Yet, for them, female life expectancy at the time was perhaps 30 years less than it is in Chile today. An important factor has been advance in scientific knowledge and its application both in creating powerful interventions and in guiding behavior. Acquisition and utilization of health research and development or its products becomes, then, an essential function of a country's health system. Much knowledge is embodied in global public goods: once a vaccine for hepatitis B has been developed anywhere it becomes, in some sense, available everywhere. Although monopoly pricing made possible by patents may slow the diffusion of some innovations, the temporary nature of patent-induced monopoly pricing limits this effect. But an innovation's being cheap, powerful, and globally available in no way entails its global use. There indeed appears to be enormous variation in the rate at which different countries make use of knowledge and products that are globally available. This discussion paper presents knowledge as an important function of national health systems. The paper uses the term acquisition rather than purchasing for the most part because of its more general connotation. Most of the issues such as agency roles and organization that are important for resource allocation and purchasing in general are likewise important with respect to research and development.","Health, Nutrition and Population (HNP) discussion paper",Purchasing of knowledge for health gains,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/778041468780553442/text/315870HNP0Jami1hasingKnowledgeFinal.txt,/research/2004/09/5624777/purchasing-knowledge-health-gains,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/778041468780553442/Purchasing-of-knowledge-for-health-gains,2004/09/5624777/purchasing-knowledge-health-gains,778041468780553442,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/778041468780553442/Purchasing-of-knowledge-for-health-gains,D5624777,null,"Jamison,Dean T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scope of surveillance is broad, from early warning systems for rapid response in the case of communicable diseases to planned response in the case of non-communicable diseases, where the lag time between exposure and disease is longer than for communicable diseases. Most countries have laws or regulations on mandatory reporting of a list of conditions determined by each country, primarily communicable diseases such as childhood vaccine-preventable diseases (polio, measles, tetanus, and diphtheria), TB, hepatitis, meningitis, and leprosy. Relatively small investments can be very effective in reducing death, disease, and disability. Surveillance can make the health system more effective and efficient, and better able to control devastating epidemics. It can lead to early detection of local epidemics when control is more effective, less costly, and involves less loss of life. Surveillance is also important for controlling and preventing endemic diseases that reduce productivity and can be costly to manage. Good surveillance systems permit early identification of diseases such as TB and syphilis that can be cured easily with low-cost treatments, combined with other public health actions.","Public Health at a Glance,HNP notes",Surveillance,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/239131468160515361/pdf/536490BRI0ENGL10Box345621B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/239131468160515361/text/536490BRI0ENGL10Box345621B01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2006/05/11994142/surveillance,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/239131468160515361/Surveillance,2006/05/11994142/surveillance,239131468160515361,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/239131468160515361/Surveillance,D11994142,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The provisions for dam safety are believed to be the most detailed ever undertaken for a major dam. A wide range of safety features are provided: 1) access to road systems from either bank; 2) a comprehensive communication system; 3) emergency power supplies; 4) an integrated reservoir flood regulation plan; 5) emergency response planning; and 6) a flood emergency response system. In addition, stability testing in the event of earthquakes was undertaken. Resettlement planning and management takes into account not only the population directly affected by the project, but also the population in the areas receiving resettlers. Studies of resettlement include: economic effects; preferential policies; housing, amenities, and public services; social and cultural aspects; grievance and complaint procedures; safety net; and transport capacity for relocation. The cultural heritage is being preserved by a detailed comprehensive archaeological exploration, classification and salvage program that will locate, recover and protect important underground and surface relics and cultural treasures in the inundated area. To ensure public health, programs have been set in place to prevent communicable diseases common in the study area such as: malaria, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, brucellosis, paragonimiasis, and sanitation-related enteric diseases including dysentery, hepatitis and typhoid.",,China - Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Dam Project : environmental impact assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/849291468744010791/pdf/multi-page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/849291468744010791/text/multi-page.txt,/projects/documents/1993/02/699123/china-xiaolangdi-multipurpose-dam-project-environmental-impact-assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/849291468744010791/China-Xiaolangdi-Multipurpose-Dam-Project-environmental-impact-assessment,2017/03/699123/china-xiaolangdi-multipurpose-dam-project-environmental-impact-assessment,849291468744010791,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/849291468744010791/China-Xiaolangdi-Multipurpose-Dam-Project-environmental-impact-assessment,D699123,184,"Reconnaissance, Planning & Design Institute",Yell,"Flood protection,Central Government (Central Agencies),Power",,,,,,,,,,,reservoir;flood control;dam;reservoir area;reservoir water level;benefits of flood control;sale of farm product;operation and maintenance cost;resettlement plan;sediment deposition;standard of living;environmental protection measures;adverse environmental effect;flood protection;dam site;adequate sanitation facility;greenhouse gas emission;industrial water supply;river channel;public health;emergency response planning;laws and regulation;reduction in groundwater;infrastructure and services;flood detention basin;cost of construction;global environmental issue;dam during construction;environmental management activities;average annual temperature;flood control benefit;emergency power supply;resettlement of people;water storage capacity;surface water quality;flora and fauna;panel of expert;construction and operation;mosquito breeding site;high silt content;transfer of technology;generation of electricity;public health problem;resettlement and rehabilitation;preliminary resettlement plans;water supply system;surface water supply;agriculture and industry;regulating water supply;improved water supply;Environmental Management Plan;enteric disease;construction area;hemorrhagic fever;affected population;river bed;irrigation;downstream river;large reservoir;administrative village;reservoir storage;reservoir capacity;energy output;sediment management;silt deposition;sediment control;Environmental Assessment;sediment load;installed capacity;hydroelectric plant;environmental component;resettlement program;involuntary resettlement;resettlement planning;discharge capacity;flood hazard;emergency spillway;river course;agricultural land;Power Generation;host families;construction period;cultural relic;agricultural production;cultural resource;safety problem;dam stability;transport capacity;agricultural area;agricultural income;clean water;construction site;coastal area;baseline data;transition period;rare species;preferential policies;flow volume;downstream region;Host Communities;power production;downstream siltation;beneficial use;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constructional phase will be characterized by transfer and prefabricated materials, equipment/machinery, and transport of workers to the site. These activities will affect the already heavy vehicular traffic, and pose accident risks resulting from occupational hazards as well. Transport of soils and materials will generate dust. Heavy construction vehicles and equipment may generate noise. Solid waste in the form of debris and topsoil will be carried off to sites. As the site is cleared in preparation for construction, there will be loss of fauna and flora. During the occupational phase, potential hazards would be posed by exposure to hazardous health care waste. Hazardous waste comprises infectious agents, hazardous chemicals like disinfectants or obsolete pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, genotoxic waste such as cytotoxic drugs, radioactive materials, and sharps. There is a particular concern that infection with immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis B and C could be transmitted through health care waste, that is, injuries from syringes contaminated by human blood or through secretions. After weighing various options, the report concludes that the best disposal methods for treated health care waste are controlled disposal at a proper sanitary landfill and burial in cemeteries or a crematorium.

Adverse environmental health impacts, mainly inadvertent spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), could occur when an emergency operation involves containment of HPAI outbreaks through quarantine, isolation and stamping out actions and when relevant mitigation measures are not in place. Most of the key potential impacts could be avoided or minimized by integrating environmental and public health safety aspects in the preparation/design and implementation of project activities. A National Medical Waste Management Plan (NMWMP) will ensure the (i) environmental and social sound disposal of infected carcasses and thus preventing the further spread if HPAI; and (ii) safe medical waste management at the health care facilities and waste dump sites to prevent the further spread of diseases including hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS due to unsafe medical waste management.

This component will mainly finance results using Disbursement-linked Indicators (DLIs) achieved and verified by an independent verification agency (IVA) although there are specific activities under this component which will also be financed using the regular Investment Project Financing (IPF) disbursement method. This component includes four subcomponents: providing for quality services at PHCs; strengthen community health worker (CHW) program; supporting health and family planning activities; and screening for Hep C and risk factors for high burden diseases. The second component is the strengthen secondary level care. This component will strengthen the integration of services through enhancing procedures, logistics and operations that will empower hospitals to provide comprehensive quality services to the population residing in their catchment areas. Further, the component will finance the costs associated with accreditation activities as per the national accreditation guidelines for hospitals. The component will also enhance activities aiming at maintaining safe blood supply to the population to cut back on one of the highest sources of viral infection for Hep C. Lastly, the component will finance the costs associated with medical treatment of Hep C patients. This component includes three subcomponents: providing for quality services at hospitals; improve the blood bank network; and treatment of Hep C. The third component is the institutional capacity building and project management. Finally, the fourth component is the contingency emergency and response component.

This study explores the linkage between glue sniffing and other drug use and high risk practices related to increased vulnerability and risk for HIV and AIDS in Bangladesh and also documents the serious health effects of glue sniffing. Although Bangladesh has an overall low prevalence of HIV, it is facing a concentrated HIV epidemic among injecting drug users. There is a risk that young children who inhale glue may also be more likely to use other drugs, and that this early introduction to drugs lead to injecting drug habits, associated with increased risk for transmission of HIV, hepatitis C and other sexually transmitted diseases. This study aimed at assessing the nature of drug use and other risky practices among street children aged 11 to 19 years in Dhaka and Chittagong, the two major metropolises of Bangladesh. The study highlights the vulnerability of street children in general and the problems they face on the streets, primarily due to their lack of social protection.

They were also found to be sexually active early and most of them were engaged in unprotected sex, most girls selling sex, and most boys reporting low condom use. Although this study was not designed to determine a direct causal link between early solvent abuse, injecting drug use and HIV, the study shows an association between glue sniffing, injecting drug use and other risky sexual practices, which amplifies the risk for HIV among these children, making the case for intervening early.",,Glue sniffing and other risky practices among street children in urban Bangladesh,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/282401468334778800/pdf/704310ESW0P11100report0final0Nov027.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/282401468334778800/text/704310ESW0P11100report0final0Nov027.txt,/research/2011/11/16465389/glue-sniffing-other-risky-practices-among-street-children-urban-bangladesh,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/282401468334778800/Glue-sniffing-and-other-risky-practices-among-street-children-in-urban-Bangladesh,2011/11/16465389/glue-sniffing-other-risky-practices-among-street-children-urban-bangladesh,282401468334778800,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/282401468334778800/Glue-sniffing-and-other-risky-practices-among-street-children-in-urban-Bangladesh,D16465389,63,"Mahmud, Iffat","Ahsan, Karar Zunaid",Health,,,"Claeson, Mariam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The World Bank had supported the creation of a national database of social assistance programs to ensure efficiency and eliminate fraud in the system.

The original Credit for the project in the amount of SDR11.3 million (US$17 million equivalent) was approved on June 7, 2007, and became effective on September 5, 2007. Implementation pace has picked up momentum over FY11, and, at present, 65 percent of the total Credit is disbursed , and 87 percent of the amount available is already committed in contracts signed that are being implemented. The Ministry of Health (MoH) new leadership, established since December 2010, is highly committed to the Project, and it has ramped up its initiative on health reforms. The project Director Position for the development of the new information system has been created in fall of 2010, to foster coordination across all units internal and external to Ministry of Labor, Social Protection and Family (MoLSPF) which will benefit from the new information system. Strengthening of the project activities is also underpinned by the overall reorganization of the MoH, approved by Government of Moldova on May 25, 2011.",,Moldova - Health Services and Social Assistance Project : restructuring : Main report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/900891468275055163/pdf/635280PJPR0v100vised0August0102011.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/900891468275055163/text/635280PJPR0v100vised0August0102011.txt,/projects/documents/2011/08/14758048/moldova-health-services-social-assistance-project-restructuring-main-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/900891468275055163/Main-report,2011/08/14758048/moldova-health-services-social-assistance-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report,900891468275055163,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/900891468275055163/Main-report,D14758048,7,,,"Health,Central Government (Central Agencies),Compulsory health finance,Other social services",Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially true in the world’s poorest countries, where gaps are great in what women learn, earn, and are taught they can hope to achieve in their lives. Empowering girls and women so they survive childbirth, get a better education, and secure better paying jobs is vital to ending extreme poverty by 2030, boosting shared prosperity, and building resilient communities. It can help set countries on a sustainable path toward more diversified economies, higher productivity, and better prospects for the next generation. Gender equality is a key priority for the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest. IDA is uniquely suited to support gender equality outcomes, which requires integrating work across multiple sectors and sustaining efforts over long periods. IDA works to close gender gaps by getting and keeping girls in school, helping women gain access to land titles and other vital assets, providing women with training in sustainable farming practices, and ensuring they can obtain financing to start businesses.

Empowering girls and women so they survive childbirth, get a better education, and secure better paying jobs is vital to ending extreme poverty by 2030, boosting shared prosperity, and building resilient communities. It can help set countries on a sustainable path toward more diversified economies, higher productivity, and better prospects for the next generation.

IDA is uniquely suited to support gender equality outcomes, which requires integrating work across multiple sectors and sustaining efforts over long periods.

The closing date for the project will be extended from August 31, 2011 to August 31, 2013. The original Credit for the project in the amount of SDR11.3 million (US$17 million equivalent) was approved on June 7, 2007, and became effective on September 5, 2007. Implementation pace has picked up momentum over FY11, and, at present, 65 percent of the total Credit is disbursed , and 87 percent of the amount available is already committed in contracts signed that are being implemented. The Ministry of Health (MoH) new leadership, established since December 2010, is highly committed to the Project, and it has ramped up its initiative on health reforms. The project Director Position for the development of the new information system has been created in fall of 2010, to foster coordination across all units internal and external to Ministry of Labor, Social Protection and Family (MoLSPF) which will benefit from the new information system. Strengthening of the project activities is also underpinned by the overall reorganization of the MoH, approved by Government of Moldova on May 25, 2011.",,Moldova - Health Services and Social Assistance Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/684021468109729867/pdf/635280PJPR0v200ructuring0Data0sheet-doc.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/684021468109729867/text/635280PJPR0v200ructuring0Data0sheet-doc.txt,/projects/documents/2011/08/14757934/moldova-health-services-social-assistance-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/684021468109729867/Data-sheet,2011/08/14757934/moldova-health-services-social-assistance-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet,684021468109729867,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/684021468109729867/Data-sheet,D14757934,3,,,"Health,Central Government (Central Agencies),Compulsory health finance,Other social services",Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These changes were supported by World Bank financing. The Health Services and Social Assistance Project aims to increase access to good quality and efficient health services. It also wants to increase coverage for recipients of health services with the ultimate goal of decreasing premature mortality and disability rates. Improving Moldova's primary health care system is only part of the solution.

This is especially true in the world’s poorest countries, where gaps are great in what women learn, earn, and are taught they can hope to achieve in their lives. Empowering girls and women so they survive childbirth, get a better education, and secure better paying jobs is vital to ending extreme poverty by 2030, boosting shared prosperity, and building resilient communities. It can help set countries on a sustainable path toward more diversified economies, higher productivity, and better prospects for the next generation. Gender equality is a key priority for the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest. IDA is uniquely suited to support gender equality outcomes, which requires integrating work across multiple sectors and sustaining efforts over long periods. IDA works to close gender gaps by getting and keeping girls in school, helping women gain access to land titles and other vital assets, providing women with training in sustainable farming practices, and ensuring they can obtain financing to start businesses. This helps improve the economic prospects for individuals, families and whole economies.",,El ABC de la AIF : Principales Logros de la AIF - Género,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/120591533549463476/pdf/ABCs-of-IDA-Key-Achievements-by-Country-Gender.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/120591533549463476/text/ABCs-of-IDA-Key-Achievements-by-Country-Gender.txt,/research/2016/06/30328399/abcs-ida-key-achievements-country-gender,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/120591533549463476/ABCs-of-IDA-Key-Achievements-by-Country-Gender,2016/06/30328399/abcs-ida-key-achievements-country-gender,120591533549463476,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/120591533549463476/ABCs-of-IDA-Key-Achievements-by-Country-Gender,D30328399,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also wants to increase coverage for recipients of health services with the ultimate goal of decreasing premature mortality and disability rates. Improving Moldova's primary health care system is only part of the solution.

This Handbook explains the basics of logistics and supply chain management for commodities that support HIV/AIDS programs. It seeks to demonstrate the importance of taking logistics considerations into account when planning for the scale-up of HIV/AIDS programs. The handbook provides practical guidelines for program managers, donors and other partners in planning for the management of commodities to support HIV/AIDS programs. However, the authors assume that the readers are familiar with logistics concepts. The reference section at the back of this manual provides a list of books and articles for those who would like to get general information on logistics and drug supply management.

The construction of these bridges will impact on the surface water quality the impact will come from the oil that may leak into the river; the construction under water will cause silts to be suspended, the loss of abandoned construction waste or construction material, construction clay mortar and domestic wastewater near construction site. In operation period, the sewage sources are mainly locomotive depot, wastewater that contains oil discharged from production sections such as vehicle section and domestic wastewater discharged from each station. The main air pollution in construction phase will be from construction dust. After implementation of the project, the existing diesel engine traction locomotives will be replaced by electric traction locomotive. Domestic waste and train waste generated from each station and section will also increase. A new environment impact, electromagnetic pollution will occur. The local land resources will definitely be impacted due to the large amount of land acquisition and removal. Following are some of the mitigation measures: (i) the railway line will be carefully selected to avoid occupying the sensitive ecosystems; (ii) the earthworks will use the excavated earth as backfill where at all possible and minimize the occupation of farmland, cultivated land, and woodlands; (iii) vertical landscaping shall be carried out on the outer sides of the railway stations; (iv) the operation of high-level noise construction shall be 200 meters far from the residential areas, and the low-level noise equipment shall be adopted. Main construction activities shall be strictly controlled within the daytime. Temporary sound-insulation facilities shall be used to decrease the effect of mechanical noise. Construction vehicles shall be arranged to steer clear of the residential areas whenever possible. At the ZheGanLine same time, such vehicles are forbidden to go through the residential areas at night; and (v) watering shall be carried out for temporary roads that have not been laid that are built for the various railway construction site. It shall be done two times per day (one time in morning and another in afternoon) to ease the pollution of dust emissions. The number of watering shall be augmented in dry or blustery contractors Zheanline weather. Covering canvas shall be used for the transportation of cement, sand, lime, and so on.

This Project aims to providing socioeconomic services to grassroots population by combining actions of various stakeholders at communal, local levels and private as well as public sectors. The project goal is to improve young people's access to part-time jobs and opportunities for skills development. This will be achieved through High-labor-Works (hereinafter referred to as THIMO), Skills Development advocacy and strengthening of institutional capacity. The possible negative environmental and social impacts which will be experienced if the framework of the construction works of social and community infrastructures include: destruction of some plant species existing on the target sites for infrastructures; degradation of the harmony of the landscape; pollution and degradation; pollution of surface waters; air pollution by dust and gaseous emissions by fumes when burning or incinerating waste; pollution and nuisances on the site and the surrounding environment due to poor solid waste management; environmental degradation (pollution of natural environments and outlets); misuse of gutters and their conversion into garbage dumps because of lack of maintenance program and public awareness raising advocacy; malfunctioning of social structures due to a default in construction works completion; disturbance and nuisance caused by road traffic activity and site preparation; traffic disturbance during construction; noise and vibration caused by vehicles operating in residential areas. Potential negative social impacts/risks: risk of deterioration health and the public sanitation system (cholera, diarrhea epidemics) around collecting/processing points; risk of spreading STIs and AIDS owing to permanent interaction between populations; risk of prevalence of water-borne diseases ; risk of temporary interruption of income generating activities performed by retailers in the vicinities of the eligible sites; risk of physical displacement of people located on the eligible sites; conflicts between different stakeholders; no use of local labor; environmental and health risks due to biomedical wastes (hospital-based infections, infection diseases such as hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, etc.). To mitigate potential adverse impacts associated with the implementation of the project and meet the expectations of the population, an Environmental and Social Management Plan has been set and recommendations made: choose carefully the sites, inform the local population before the work starts, carefully monitor hygiene and security in the construction sites, prepare signs to inform about construction work, hire local population first, check that security measures are implemented on construction sites, collect all waste and dispose it, inform population about sexually transmitted disease.",,Burkina Faso - Youth Employment and Skills Development : Burkina Faso - Projet d’emploi des jeunes et de Développement des compétences,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/411541468228292189/pdf/E41920Burkina000090201300Box374381B.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/411541468228292189/text/E41920Burkina000090201300Box374381B.txt,/projects/documents/2013/03/17567710/burkina-faso-youth-employment-skills-development-burkina-faso-projet-d’emploi-des-jeunes-de-développement-des-compétences,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/411541468228292189/Burkina-Faso-Projet-d-emploi-des-jeunes-et-de-Développement-des-compétences,2013/03/17567710/burkina-faso-youth-employment-skills-development-burkina-faso-projet-demploi-des-jeunes-de-développement-des-compétences,411541468228292189,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/411541468228292189/Burkina-Faso-Projet-d-emploi-des-jeunes-et-de-Développement-des-compétences,D17567710,104,,,"Other social services,Adult, Basic and Continuing Education,Vocational training,Public administration - Other social services",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,West Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reallocation is justified given that the institutions subordinated by the Ministry of labor, social protection and family and the Ministry of health are affected by the current food price increases, and lack budget resources to accommodate these increases.

Both the Bank and the Borrower received moderately satisfactory performance ratings. The project was restricted twice. Due to a lack of progress on implementation the following changes were made to the project: (a) revision of the RF to provide more effective monitoring; and (b) extension of the credit closing date. A component was also added to the project as part of the additional financing grant. Component 4: Protecting health and nutritional status, provided financing to cover expenses related to (a) procurement of commodities (food and nutritional supplements) for pregnant or lactating women and children under 3 years of age; and (b) cash transfers to specialized institutions, which provided food to children, handicapped people, the homeless, orphans, the elderly, and victims of domestic violence, and other vulnerable groups to compensate for food price increases. The following lessons were learned from this project: (1) Health and social sector reforms are costly, but long lasting. (2) Strong government ownership is important, mainly with reform-oriented projects. Reforms in health and social sectors are not purely about technical issues, but depend profoundly on ownership, institutional capacity, and the political process.

In December 2006, Vietnam became one of four countries in the Water and Sanitation Program's (WSP) Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project. The objective of the project was to learn how to stimulate improved hand washing behaviors at large scale, sustain the activities after the project ended, and measure the impact on behavioral, health, and welfare outcomes. This learning note presents the achievements, learning, and reflections that resulted from implementing a large-scale hand washing program in Vietnam and provides recommendations for future hygiene promotion initiatives. During the four-year implementation (2006-2010), the program achieved all four of its key objectives. However, a randomized control trial (RCT) impact evaluation found no significant changes in hand washing behavior and no impact on health in children under two. Although much has been learned about how to implement a nation-wide communication program in Vietnam, behavior change at scale has proven challenging.",Water and Sanitation Program Learning Note,"Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project : results, impacts, and learning from Vietnam : Du an Rua tay voi Xa phong Mo rong Toan cau : ket qua , tac dong va kinh nghiem o Viet Nam",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/563841468127189029/pdf/731340BRI0VIET0C0disclosed010090120.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/563841468127189029/text/731340BRI0VIET0C0disclosed010090120.txt,/research/2012/09/16814675/global-scaling-up-handwashing-project-results-impacts-learning-vietnam-du-rua-tay-voi-xa-phong-mo-rong-toan-cau-ket-qua-tac-dong-va-kinh-nghiem-o-viet-nam,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/563841468127189029/Du-an-Rua-tay-voi-Xa-phong-Mo-rong-Toan-cau-ket-qua-tac-dong-va-kinh-nghiem-o-Viet-Nam,2012/09/16814675/global-scaling-up-handwashing-project-results-impacts-learning-vietnam-du-rua-tay-voi-xa-phong-mo-rong-toan-cau-ket-qua-tac-dong-va-kinh-nghiem-o-viet-nam,563841468127189029,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/563841468127189029/Du-an-Rua-tay-voi-Xa-phong-Mo-rong-Toan-cau-ket-qua-tac-dong-va-kinh-nghiem-o-Viet-Nam,D16814675,8,"Nguyen, Nga Kim - Devine, Jacqueline",,,Southeast Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report aims to add to this body of evidence through the conduct of a comprehensive review of the scheme within the context of the overall family medicine program. It describes and assesses Turkey's performance based payment scheme in family medicine with regard to design, institutional arrangements, governance, monitoring and evaluation, implementation, results and financial implications. Potential areas for improvement are identified and further refinements of the current system are suggested. The report will also contribute to the current body of knowledge on the experience with pay for performance in primary care for the interest of other countries. The study methodology uses both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Further as the scheme was rolled out among Turkey's provinces gradually, the quantitative assessment uses before-and-after comparisons for providers/provinces in the scheme as well as comparison of providers/provinces in the scheme and outside the scheme where feasible. Three focus groups were conducted with Family Medicine Practice (FMP) doctors, FMP health personnel and division chiefs (or deputies) from the provincial administration/Community Health Centers (CHC) to obtain their views about the performance-based contracting scheme and to complement the information gathered from other sources.",,Turkey - Performance based contracting scheme in family medicine : design and achievements : Turkey - Aile hekimliginde performansa dayali sozlesme uygulamasi : tasarim ve kazanimlar,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/830471468109442263/pdf/770290Revised002B00PUBLIC00Turkish0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/830471468109442263/text/770290Revised002B00PUBLIC00Turkish0.txt,/research/2013/02/17747081/turkey-performance-based-contracting-scheme-family-medicine-design-achievements-turkey-aile-hekimliginde-performansa-dayali-sozlesme-uygulamasi-tasarim-ve-kazanimlar,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/830471468109442263/Turkey-Aile-hekimliginde-performansa-dayali-sozlesme-uygulamasi-tasarim-ve-kazanimlar,2013/02/17747081/Turkey-Aile-hekimliginde-performansa-dayali-sozlesme-uygulamasi-tasarim-ve-kazanimlar,830471468109442263,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/830471468109442263/Turkey-Aile-hekimliginde-performansa-dayali-sozlesme-uygulamasi-tasarim-ve-kazanimlar,D17747081,61,,,Health,Europe,,,,,,,,,,,Middle East,World,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CPS' primary objective is to make a critical contribution to promoting diversified and inclusive economic growth in addition to improving social outcomes. To ensure effective implementation in both priority areas, the CPS also supports governance and institutional capacity building as a cross-cutting theme. The CPS' main themes are fully in line with the new World Bank Strategy for Africa, namely: competitiveness and employment, and vulnerability and resilience, underpinned by good governance and capacity building. The Republic of Congo reached Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point in January 2010. Reaching the completion point has emboldened the authorities and the Congolese people to envisage a more ambitious phase of Congo's development. This has helped strengthen the dialogue with the Bank which has become more mature, and has heightened the prospects for deepening the reforms. This CPS progress report: (i) reviews progress to date toward achieving the CPS' objectives and outcomes; (ii) provides a brief update on the new contextual imperatives within the country with a view to drawing implications for the continued relevance of the Bank's strategy, including defining a plan of activities over the next two fiscal years; and (iii) updates the assessment of the principal risks facing the CPS' implementation.",,Republic of Congo - Country partnership strategy : progress report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/406901468234270345/pdf/607270CASP0IDA055B00public050120110.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/406901468234270345/text/607270CASP0IDA055B00public050120110.txt,/projects/documents/2011/05/14196516/republic-congo-country-partnership-strategy-progress-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/406901468234270345/Republic-of-Congo-Country-partnership-strategy-progress-report,2011/05/14196516/republic-congo-country-partnership-strategy-progress-report,406901468234270345,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/406901468234270345/Republic-of-Congo-Country-partnership-strategy-progress-report,D14196516,34,,,,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The report reviews the status of world food supplies and the prospects and needs for the future with emphasis on the developing world. It then describes bioengineering technology and the potential contributions that transgenic crops might make to alleviate problems of food security. After, it deals with possible risks from the widespread deployment of genetically altered crops. Finally, it offers conclusions and recommendations, namely, that the World Bank should support: 1) linkages with the developing world's agricultural science community; 2) high-quality research programs aimed at exploiting the favorable potential of genetic engineering for improving the lot of the developing world; 3) implementing formal, national regulatory structures in its client nations by helping these structures retain their effectiveness and by providing scientific and technical support to client nations; 4) deploying an early warning system and introducing improvements adapting new strains; 5) increasing its support of research in biotechnology and related areas at international agricultural research centers; and 6) continuing give high priority to all aspects of increasing agricultural productivity in the developing world while encouraging the necessary transition to sustainable methods.",Environmentally sustainable development studies and monographs series ; no. 23*ESSD Environmentally & Socially Sustainable Development Work in Progress,Bioengineering of crops : report of the World Bank Panel on Transgenic Crops,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/278251468739218811/text/multi-page.txt,/research/1997/10/694011/bioengineering-crops-report-world-bank-panel-transgenic-crops,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/278251468739218811/Bioengineering-of-crops-report-of-the-World-Bank-Panel-on-Transgenic-Crops,1997/10/694011/bioengineering-crops-report-world-bank-panel-transgenic-crops,278251468739218811,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/278251468739218811/Bioengineering-of-crops-report-of-the-World-Bank-Panel-on-Transgenic-Crops,D694011,null,"Kendall, Henry W.","Beachy, Roger",(Historic)Other agriculture,,,"Eisner, Thomas","Gould, Fred","Herdt, Robert","Raven, Peter H.","Schell, Jozef S.","Swaminathan, M.

It has long been clear that lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities has a wide variety of impacts; however, the data and evidence needed to verify the size of the burden imposed on the people of Pakistan are limited. As a result, investment in the water and sanitation sector remains well below what is required to ensure for the population a basic minimum of services. Indeed, Pakistan's population is projected to grow by more than 2.9 percent a year, which means an additional 4.0 million people each year who will require additional clean water and sanitation facilities. The Water and Sanitation Program undertook this study to conduct evidence based research to help advocacy in the sanitation sector. The study aims to empirically estimate the economic impacts of current poor sanitation conditions in Pakistan as well as the economic benefits of options for improved conditions. The study's ultimate goal is to provide policy makers at both national and local levels with evidence to justify larger investments in improving the sanitation conditions in the country. It also provides recommendations, again based on empirical evidence, for effectively planning and implementing sustainable sanitation and hygiene programs.",Water and sanitation program working paper,Economic impacts of inadequate sanitation in Pakistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/688081468325215343/pdf/778390WSP0BRI00Box0377295B00PUBLIC0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/688081468325215343/text/778390WSP0BRI00Box0377295B00PUBLIC0.txt,/research/2013/05/17770509/economic-impacts-inadequate-sanitation-pakistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/688081468325215343/Economic-impacts-of-inadequate-sanitation-in-Pakistan,2013/05/17770509/economic-impacts-inadequate-sanitation-pakistan,688081468325215343,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/688081468325215343/Economic-impacts-of-inadequate-sanitation-in-Pakistan,D17770509,8,,,,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of the restructuring of the healthcare system in Togo, this analysis of strengths and weaknesses of the current system seems necessary. This analysis of the health sector is based on data from the last survey Demographic and Health (DHS 2010-11). These data were used to measure the overall health of the population, through the analysis of indicators related to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on health (Chapter 2). Shared data by the Ministry of Health and that of Finance, but also by the various technical and financial partners (TFPs), were used to analyze wider issues such as community practices (Chapter 3), governance (Chapter 4), care (Chapter 5), health human resources (Chapter 6), pharmaceutical policy (Chapter 7) or the health financing in Togo (Chapter 9). But this exercise was not intended to be merely analytical. It also aimed to enrich the political dialogue between, on one hand, actors in the health sector and, secondly, the World Bank and other development partners. In its development strategy, Togo has given an important place to the health of its population. Togo is thus committed to a process of reforming its health system and to development of high impact interventions to improve the health of its people, while respecting the recommendations related to aid effectiveness. It is within these major reforms that the health sector analysis, initiated by the Ministry of Health and conducted in partnership with the Technical and Financial Partners, was completed and allowed to propose areas of government interventions.",,"Togo - Santé, Nutrition et Population Rapport Analytique Santé Pauvreté",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/325231468119080014/pdf/AAA690P12369400o0Fev020120v420FINAL.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/325231468119080014/text/AAA690P12369400o0Fev020120v420FINAL.txt,/research/2011/11/15881172/togo-santé-nutrition-population-rapport-analytique-santé-pauvreté,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/325231468119080014/Togo-Sant-233-Nutrition-et-Population-Rapport-Analytique-Sant-233-Pauvret-233,2011/11/15881172/togo-santé-nutrition-population-rapport-analytique-santé-pauvreté,325231468119080014,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/325231468119080014/Togo-Sant-233-Nutrition-et-Population-Rapport-Analytique-Sant-233-Pauvret-233,D15881172,252,"Lemiere,Christophe","Salami,Machikourou","Non-compulsory health finance,Health",West Africa,,"Puret,Juliette",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Successful approaches include (i) paying attention to the preferences of users and providing users with the services that they want and for which they are willing to pay; (ii) unbundling sanitation services into discrete parts (such as household services and trunk services) and providing these components in the sequence that the users prefer; and (iii) involving the creative use of both non-formal institutions and formal institutions in co-producing services, with each institution providing that part of the service for which it has a comparative advantage.",Water and sanitation program,Toward a strategic sanitation approach : improving the sustainability of urban sanitation in developing countries : Hacia un enfoque de saneamiento estrategico : Como mejorar la sostenibilidad del saneamiento urbano en los paises en desarrollo,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/321731468179329039/pdf/174350WP0SPANI0eamiento0estrategico.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/321731468179329039/text/174350WP0SPANI0eamiento0estrategico.txt,/research/1997/11/16641904/toward-strategic-sanitation-approach-improving-sustainability-urban-sanitation-developing-countries-hacia-un-enfoque-de-saneamiento-estrategico-como-mejorar-la-sostenibilidad-del-saneamiento-urbano-en-los-paises-en-desarrollo,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/321731468179329039/Hacia-un-enfoque-de-saneamiento-estrategico-Como-mejorar-la-sostenibilidad-del-saneamiento-urbano-en-los-paises-en-desarrollo,1997/11/16641904/toward-strategic-sanitation-approach-improving-sustainability-urban-sanitation-developing-countries-hacia-un-enfoque-de-saneamiento-estrategico-como-mejorar-la-sostenibilidad-del-saneamiento-urbano-en-los-paises-en-desarrollo,321731468179329039,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/321731468179329039/Hacia-un-enfoque-de-saneamiento-estrategico-Como-mejorar-la-sostenibilidad-del-saneamiento-urbano-en-los-paises-en-desarrollo,D16641904,44,"Wright,Albert M.",,(Historic)Urban water supply,,,,,,,,,,,"access to water,basic hygiene,behavioral changes,cholera,cities,City water,clean water,communicable diseases,communities,connections,construction of latrines,cost recovery,coverage with sewerage,cross-subsidies,cubic meters,decisionmaking,demand for water,diarrhea,domestic waste,Drinking Water,effective sanitation,family health,groundwater,health risks,hepatitis,hepatitis A,hygiene education,inadequate sanitation,infant mortality,informal settlements,local community,municipal authorities,Municipal water,municipalities,neighborhood,neighborhood associations,neighborhoods,operational efficiency,participatory approaches,performance improvements,physical infrastructure,pollution,poor urban dwellers,population growth,public service providers,public utilities,rapid urbanization,river water,roads,RURAL SANITATION,safe water,sanitary crisis,sanitation,sanitation,sanitation coverage,Sanitation Decade,sanitation development,sanitation facilities,sanitation improvements,sanitation investments,sanitation problems,Sanitation Program,sanitation projects,sanitation sector,sanitation services,sanitation system,sanitation systems,service providers,service provision,sewage collection,sewerage,sewerage systems,slum clearance,slums,squatter settlements,sustainable sanitation,sustainable services,taxation,typhoid,urban areas,urban dwellers,urban environment,urban poor,urban population,urban residents,urban sanitation,urban sanitation problems,urban settlements,users,utilities,wastes,wastewater treatment,water,water resources,water sources,Water Supply,wells,Sanitation; Pollution; Diseases; Management; Macroeconomic planning; Developing countries; Rural areas; Urban areas; Finance; Cost recovery; Strategic planning; Sanitation services; Disease prevention; Water quality management; Waste management; Urban conditions; Environmental conditions; Environmental degradation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vaccine procurement is a complex issue that interweaves the domains of public health, commodity security, ethics, and procurement. Its cross-disciplinary nature means that neither a straightforward analysis stemming from just one discipline nor a cookie-cutter application of World Bank procurement principles of economy, efficiency, equal opportunity, promoting domestic contracting and transparency will lead to an optimal solution. A more holistic approach is required. The World Bank has therefore historically considered vaccine procurement as 'special' and has allowed for exceptions from its guidelines for World Bank funded vaccine procurement. The study was designed to provide strong operational recommendations for issues such as efficiency, price, quality control, and logistics management. This study is intended mainly for internal purposes to facilitate discussions with Operations Policy and Country Service (OPCS) regarding refining the World Bank's position on procurement or supply of vaccine through United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).",,Study on comparative efficiencies in vaccine procurement mechanisms,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/960191468302960225/pdf/683510ESW0P11000eff0in0vaccine0proc.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/960191468302960225/text/683510ESW0P11000eff0in0vaccine0proc.txt,/research/2008/06/16259408/study-comparative-efficiencies-vaccine-procurement-mechanisms,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/960191468302960225/Study-on-comparative-efficiencies-in-vaccine-procurement-mechanisms,2008/06/16259408/study-comparative-efficiencies-vaccine-procurement-mechanisms,960191468302960225,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/960191468302960225/Study-on-comparative-efficiencies-in-vaccine-procurement-mechanisms,D16259408,62,,,Health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been more than 25 years since the discovery of HIV, but no scientific study has provided a comprehensive data-driven synthesis of HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) infectious spread in this region. The current report provides the first comprehensive scientific assessment and data-driven epidemiological synthesis of HIV spread in MENA since the beginning of the epidemic. It is based on a literature review and analysis of thousands of widely unrecognized publications, reports, and data sources extracted from scientific literature or collected from sources at the local, national, and regional levels. The recommendations provided here focus on key strategies related to the scope of this report and its emphasis on understanding HIV epidemiology in MENA as a whole. The recommendations are based on identifying the status of the HIV epidemic in MENA, through this synthesis, as a low HIV prevalence setting with rising concentrated epidemics among priority populations. General directions for prevention interventions as warranted by the outcome of this synthesis are also discussed briefly, but are not delineated because they are beyond the scope of this report.

Also, half of its future centers willbe located in smaller cities to make dialysis services more accessible to lower-income patients. Future clinics will continue to be a mix of hospital-based and stand-alone centers, with an emphasis on increasing the number ofcenters in public hospitals. Continuing to serve thoseon public insurance will be key to reaching low-income populations.International expansion is also on the horizon for NephroPlus. The company has set a goal of expanding tofive additional countries by 2020 and is planning to openclinics in Africa and elsewhere in Asia. As NephroPlus assesses whether it can apply its model in an international context, it must consider other factors such as policy advocacy, talent acquisition, supply chain development,and the availability of public insurance programs—all of which have enabled the company to deliver affordable,high-quality dialysis in India. As it seeks to expand access to the underserved, NephroPlus is focused on countries that have the greatest need and that can accommodate affordable prices for dialysis.",IFC Inclusive business case study,NephroPlus,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796881506589851905/pdf/120087-BRI-PUBLIC-NephroPlus-Builtforchangereport.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796881506589851905/text/120087-BRI-PUBLIC-NephroPlus-Builtforchangereport.txt,/research/2016/01/28014001/nephroplus,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796881506589851905/NephroPlus,2016/01/28014001/nephroplus,796881506589851905,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796881506589851905/NephroPlus,D28014001,10,,,,South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

La incidencia es m&#225;s alta (5% de los adultos) entre los grupos de ingreso bajo, que incluyen muchos inmigrantes haitianos que viven en comunidades rurales y trabajan en las plantaciones de ca&#241;a de az&#250;car. La incidencia entre las mujeres que se dedican al comercio sexual ronda el 8%, aunque en algunas ciudades llega a 12%. La tuberculosis (TB) es la infecci&#243;n oportunista m&#225;s frecuente entre las personas que tienen SIDA. La Oficina Panamericana de la Salud calcula que m&#225;s de 100 personas por cada 100.000 est&#225;n infectadas con TB, en comparaci&#243;n con 2,6 por cada 100.000 en Barbados y 4,9 por cada 100.000 en Jamaica. Los 5.320 casos informados en la Rep&#250;blica Dominicana es una de las cifras m&#225;s altas de Am&#233;rica Latina y el Caribe.",En breve ; no. 49,República Dominicana - Proyecto de Prevención y Control del VIH/SIDA: Primeros resultados : Proyecto de prevención y control del VIH/SIDA en República Dominicana: Primeros resultados,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515431468233352501/pdf/307290SPANISH010Box345628B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515431468233352501/text/307290SPANISH010Box345628B01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2004/07/12050376/dominican-republic-hivaids-prevention-control-project-initial-results-proyecto-de-prevencion-y-control-del-vihsida-en-republica-dominicana-primeros-resultados,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515431468233352501/Proyecto-de-prevencion-y-control-del-VIH-SIDA-en-Republica-Dominicana-primeros-resultados,2004/07/12050376/dominican-republic-hivaids-prevention-control-project-initial-results-proyecto-de-prevencion-y-control-del-vihsida-en-republica-dominicana-primeros-resultados,515431468233352501,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515431468233352501/Proyecto-de-prevencion-y-control-del-VIH-SIDA-en-Republica-Dominicana-primeros-resultados,D12050376,4,"Marquez,Patricio V.","Montalvo, Luis Emilio",,Latin America & Caribbean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The author have supported all phases of implementation, including participation by senior staff in the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) High Committee that guides this work and that is comprised of high level representation from all relevant ministries. This report is the project's first output. Forthcoming reports will provide analysis on the extent and nature of poverty and inequality, including a profile of poor Iraqis, maps of living conditions, impact analysis of existing and proposed government programs (for example, subsidies, safety nets, education, and health services), and other issues. Forthcoming publications will also include excerpts from interviews conducted with the fieldworkers who carried out this survey on the ground, illustrating the human context and personal heroism that might otherwise be disguised by the massive volume of 'dry numbers' reported here. The final output of this project will be the poverty reduction strategy itself. The survey has four main objectives. These are to: i) provide data that will help in the measurement and analysis of poverty; ii) provide data required to establish a new consumer price index (CPI) since the current outdated CPI is based on 1993 data and no longer applies to the country's vastly changed circumstances; iii) provide data that meet the requirements and needs of national accounts; and iv) provide other indicators, such as consumption expenditure, sources of income, human development, and time use.",,Iraq household socio-economic survey IHSES - 2007 : tabulation report (Vol. 3) : Annexes,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/742731468044342325/pdf/471970v30WP0Bo1rvey0v30eng01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/742731468044342325/text/471970v30WP0Bo1rvey0v30eng01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2008/12/10192872/iraq-household-socio-economic-survey-ihses-2007-tabulation-report-vol-3-annexes,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/742731468044342325/Annexes,2008/12/10192872/iraq-household-socio-economic-survey-ihses-2007-tabulation-report-vol-3-3-annexes,742731468044342325,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/742731468044342325/Annexes,D10192872,107,,,,Middle East,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the previous centuries, global pandemics of infectious diseases, such as smallpox, cholera, and influenza, periodically threatened the survival of entire populations. By the mid-twentieth century, safe, effective, and affordable vaccines and the increasing availability of antibiotics had further reduced the toll of infectious diseases in high-income countries (HICs). The international health regulations of the World Health Organization (WHO) represent a key agreement among 196 countries to implement metrics and measures to detect and control outbreaks of infectious diseases and to prevent pandemics. The authors provide updated estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the major sets of interventions, recognizing that there are large knowledge gaps concerning the economics of many conditions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The authors conclude by outlining future strategies that are relevant to continued progress against these major infectious diseases.",Disease control priorities,Major infectious diseases,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/367491510136621580/pdf/121003-PUB-ADDBOX-405304B-PUBLIC-PUBDATE-11-3-17.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/367491510136621580/text/121003-PUB-ADDBOX-405304B-PUBLIC-PUBDATE-11-3-17.txt,/research/2017/11/28141909/major-infectious-diseases,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/367491510136621580/Major-infectious-diseases,2017/11/28141909/major-infectious-diseases,367491510136621580,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/367491510136621580/Major-infectious-diseases,D28141909,509,"Holmes,King K.","Bertozzi,Stefano M.",,,,"Bloom,Barry R.","Jha,Prabhat K.","Gelband,Hellen","DeMaria,Lisa M.","Horton,Susan E.","Danforth,Kristen","Granich,Reuben","Wiedeman,Danielle",,,,"Baxi,Sanjiv","978-1-4648-0524-0,978-1-4648-0525-7","Padian,Nancy","Casper,Corey","Crane,Heidi","Menon,Manoj","Money,Deborah","Harripersaud,Katherine","McNairy,Margaret","Ahmed,Saeed","Abrams,Elaine J.","Thirumurthy,Harsha","El-Sadr,Wafaa M.","Holmes,Charles B.","Hallett,Timothy B.","Walensky,Rochelle P.","Barnighausen,Till","John-Stewart,Grace","Peeling,Rosanna W.","Levin,Carol","Garcia,Patricia J.","Mabey,David","Kinuthia,John Muratha","Garnett,Geoff P.","Krishnaratne,Shari","Harris,Kate L.","Santos,Michael","Enstone,Joanne E.","Hensen,Bernadette","Dallabetta,Gina","Revill,Paul","Gregson,Simon A.

The water and sanitation program undertook this study to conduct evidence based research to help advocacy in the sanitation sector. The study aims to empirically estimate the economic impacts of current poor sanitation conditions in Pakistan as well as the economic benefits of options for improved conditions. This study was conducted on the basis of secondary data and hence was constrained by the non-availability of relevant data in many cases. It would be preferable that information on health education and sanitation-related information be incorporated in future national surveys. Special treatment and attention are needed in the areas where the poor population lives and in rural areas, where children are more at risk from diarrhea and malnutrition. There is still a need to empirically establish the attributable impact factors based on primary data from Pakistan surveys for a variety of topics, in order to ensure that estimates are as accurate as possible.",Water and sanitation program,The economic impacts of inadequate sanitation in Pakistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/132701468286831158/pdf/681600WSP0Box30IC00WSP0esi0pakistan.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/132701468286831158/text/681600WSP0Box30IC00WSP0esi0pakistan.txt,/research/2011/01/16232510/economic-impacts-inadequate-sanitation-pakistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/132701468286831158/The-economic-impacts-of-inadequate-sanitation-in-Pakistan,2011/01/16232510/economic-impacts-inadequate-sanitation-pakistan,132701468286831158,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/132701468286831158/The-economic-impacts-of-inadequate-sanitation-in-Pakistan,D16232510,8,,,,South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its many dimensions require a broader focus than the traditional health specialist or engineering point of view. The need for proper HCWM has been gaining recognition slowly. It can: help control nosocomial diseases (hospital acquired infections), complementing the protective effect of proper hand washing; reduce community exposure to multi-drug resistant bacteria; prevent illegal repackaging and resale of contaminated needles; and easily and cost-effectively address health care worker safety issues, including reducing risk of needle sticks.","Public Health at a Glance,HNP notes",Health care waste management : La gestion des dechets medicaux,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/216291468160181547/pdf/536520BRI0FREN10Box345621B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/216291468160181547/text/536520BRI0FREN10Box345621B01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2004/04/11999162/health-care-waste-management-la-gestion-des-dechets-medicaux,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/216291468160181547/La-gestion-des-dechets-medicaux,2004/04/11999162/health-care-waste-management-la-gestion-des-dechets-medicaux,216291468160181547,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/216291468160181547/La-gestion-des-dechets-medicaux,D11999162,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Environment policy triggered Is only for medical waste. There are no civil works. Bank evaluation of medical waste disposal indicates that laws and regulations are adequate but there is a need for in-depth analysis of enforcement. Regarding biodiversity, the only safeguard triggered would be in the eventuality that the creation of new parks in the ""caatinga"" biome would trigger involuntary resettlement concerns under OP/BP 4.12. The Natural Habitats Safeguard OP/BP 4.04 i s not triggered as protected area creation will preserve critical habitats from degradation or conversion. No indigenous communities will be affected by new park creation hence OD 4.20 i s not triggered. The only safeguard triggered would be in the eventuality that the creation of new parks in the ""caatinga"" biome would trigger involuntary resettlement concerns under OP/BP 4.12. The Natural Habitats Safeguard OP/BP 4.04 is not triggered as protected area creation will preserve critical habitats from degradation or conversion.

This innovative reform is a policy reaction to that which previously existed in Chile and which is widespread in many developing countries, whereby the health rights of citizens remain largely undefined or implicit. Limited public resources imply in those countries that access to health care is rationed through queues, patient deflection, legal or under-the-table user fees, and low-quality care. This paper describes the AUGE reform, its implementation, and the functioning of AUGE for the poor and for non-poor citizens. This paper is organized as: section two provides a brief historic overview of health coverage in Chile's SHI system. Section three describes the SHI system in existence today. Section four describes the services offered and mechanisms in place to cover the poor under SHI, while section five spells out the benefits of SHI. Section six introduces the AUGE health reform of 2005, which sought to broaden and make explicit the rights of all SHI beneficiaries. Section seven offers information about the flows and magnitudes of health financing in SHI. Section eight focuses on the system used by Fonasa to target the poor. Section nine explains how Fonasa manages AUGE. Section ten comments on the information environment of AUGE. Section eleven addresses the equity and fiscal implications of expanding the AUGE benefits. Finally, section twelve proposes a pending policy agenda related to the coverage of the poor under SHI and the definition and management of benefits.",Universal Health Coverage (UNICO) studies series ; no. 21,Explicit health guarantees for Chileans : the AUGE benefits package : Garantias explicitas de salud para los Chilenos : el plan de beneficios del AUGE,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/389421468238169173/pdf/749580NWP0SPAN00UNICO0Spanish0Final.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/389421468238169173/text/749580NWP0SPAN00UNICO0Spanish0Final.txt,/research/2013/01/19771569/explicit-health-guarantees-chileans-auge-benefits-package-garantias-explicitas-de-salud-para-los-chilenos-el-plan-de-beneficios-del-auge,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/389421468238169173/Garantias-explicitas-de-salud-para-los-Chilenos-el-plan-de-beneficios-del-AUGE,2013/01/19771569/explicit-health-guarantees-chileans-auge-benefits-package-garantias-explicitas-de-salud-para-los-chilenos-el-plan-de-beneficios-del-auge,389421468238169173,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/389421468238169173/Garantias-explicitas-de-salud-para-los-Chilenos-el-plan-de-beneficios-del-AUGE,D19771569,46,"Bitran, Ricardo",,,South America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even in the region facing the greatest health challenges, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, ‘progress has been impressive’ Immunizations have played a role in protecting children from devastating diseases. According to UNICEF, immunizations have saved between two to three million lives, making vaccines one of the most cost-effective health interventions globally. BioE has played an important role in bringing affordable access to vaccines to children around the world. It is helping to equalize access between children living in developed countries and those born into in fragile environments. The Gates Foundation and its partners created a sustainable marketplace that has made the price of vaccines much more affordable. BioE’s quality and ability to service large-scale orders has sparked greater competition that has helped drive prices down globally. As BioE continues to introduce new vaccines, more children than ever have received life-saving immunizations that protect them from devastating diseases.

The paper highlights the leading role taken by community advocacy groups at a state and national level in responding quickly to the crisis and liaising effectively with government; and also points to the existence of bipartisan parliamentary support in formulating a strategy to combat HIV and AIDS. This included significant policy and legal reform. Among the law reforms considered are: laws prohibiting homosexual acts, age of consent laws, anti-discrimination and anti-vilification laws, drug laws, laws regulating prostitution, prison laws, and immigration laws.

Assuming a vaccine cost of $10 a dose and including estimated delivery costs, the total cost of vaccinating 21.6 million adolescents 11-14 years of age and 1 percent of adults would be Rs. 12.25 billion (US$ 245 million). To maintain the vaccination rate in the 11-14 year old cohort, an additional 6.77 million in that age range would have to be vaccinated each year, at a vaccine cost of Rs. 3.39 billion (US$ 67.5 million). An HIV-1 vaccine will greatly reduce HIV/AIDS in India, but it will not be a panacea. There will be a continued need for effective prevention programs to guard against behavior reversals or an imperfect vaccine. Key inputs for prevention, immunization, and treatment programs such as identification of various groups that could be immunized (vulnerable groups or general populations), strengthened surveillance, capacity building, operations research, and evaluation at local levels will continue to require intensive support.","Policy, Research working paper ; no.

For immunization, financial sustainability is of particular concern because the National Immunization Program (NIP) is funded predominantly with donor funds, especially by Gavi. The Kyrgyz Republic was in Gavi’s preparatory transition phase, during which the government’s contribution to new vaccine purchases increases by 15 percent per year.The Kyrgyz Republic has achieved a high level coverage rates for some vaccines, although estimated levels of coverage demonstrate persisting inequalities in government health expenditure in the Kyrgyz Republic suggest a stronger commitment to health than other LMICs. Total health expenditure was 8.2 percent of GDP in 2015 in the Kyrgyz Republic, compared to 5.7 percent in LMICs. National Immunization Program (NIP) vaccine expenditures vary considerably one year to another. Projections of the funding gap for the NIP, and of the fiscal space for health, suggest that without strong political decisions to increase or release extra resources for health, the Kyrgyz Government will not be able to cover the estimated gap in NIP funding on its own. The Kyrgyz Republic will remain in the Gavi preparatory transition phase for several more years, and a clear challenge to the sustainability of the program is the unpredictable nature of funding from all sources. Room for improving fiscal space for the immunization program exists, through: (a) increasing priority for the NIP within the existing health resource envelope; (b) increasing priority for health within the government existing resource envelope; (c) implementing measures to increase fiscal space for health as outlined in the fiscal space analysis; and (d) improving value for money in the current NIP spending and allocation, from both government and Gavi sources.",,Immunization Financing in the Kyrgyz Republic : Challenges to Long - Term Financial Sustainability of the National Immunization Program and How They Might Be Addressed,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/473991561757821095/pdf/Immunization-Financing-in-the-Kyrgyz-Republic-Challenges-to-Long-Term-Financial-Sustainability-of-the-National-Immunization-Program-and-How-They-Might-Be-Addressed.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/473991561757821095/text/Immunization-Financing-in-the-Kyrgyz-Republic-Challenges-to-Long-Term-Financial-Sustainability-of-the-National-Immunization-Program-and-How-They-Might-Be-Addressed.txt,/research/2018/06/31191395/immunization-financing-kyrgyz-republic-challenges-long-term-financial-sustainability-national-immunization-program-might-addressed,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/473991561757821095/Immunization-Financing-in-the-Kyrgyz-Republic-Challenges-to-Long-Term-Financial-Sustainability-of-the-National-Immunization-Program-and-How-They-Might-Be-Addressed,2018/06/31191395/immunization-financing-kyrgyz-republic-challenges-long-term-financial-sustainability-national-immunization-program-might-addressed,473991561757821095,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/473991561757821095/Immunization-Financing-in-the-Kyrgyz-Republic-Challenges-to-Long-Term-Financial-Sustainability-of-the-National-Immunization-Program-and-How-They-Might-Be-Addressed,D31191395,48,"Ranson,Michael Kent","Nguyen,Ha Thi Hong",,Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,Central Asia,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Dhaka water supply and sewerage authority (DWASA) treats and distributes 900 mld of water, using 239 deep tube wells and a century-old surface treatment plant. Yet this can meet only 60 percent of the city's daily water needs and this shortfall is increasing with the rapid growth of the megapolis. The challenge of shortage is compounded by problems in the transmission network, intermittent supply, leakage, pilferage and wastage wreak much damage and the unaccounted for water is estimated to be a staggering 50 percent. The old part of the city with 60 percent of Dhaka's population suffers an additional problem. The water that does flow from taps in this area is unfit for consumption. The labyrinth of narrow winding lanes and by lanes in this densely populated area makes maintenance of the distribution network of pipes virtually impossible. This bleak situation sparked off an idea that is remarkably simple and equally effective Tiash water supply distributes 9000 liters' of potable water to some 1500 consumers in the old part of Dhaka everyday. A shop-cum-holding area stocks water in durable plastic containers for sale and delivery to clients. Delivery personnel in rickshaw carts and on foot do the rounds of the narrow serpentine alleys in the morning to deposit a pre-determine quantity at each stop. This creates great cause for concern since many residents are of the opinion that river water is not adequately treated and people attempt home based purification such as boiling sedimentation and even the addition of mild antiseptic or disinfectant.

This is especially true in the world’s poorest countries, where gaps are great in what women learn, earn, and are taught they can hope to achieve in their lives. Empowering girls and women so they survive childbirth, get a better education, and secure better paying jobs is vital to ending extreme poverty by 2030, boosting shared prosperity, and building resilient communities. It can help set countries on a sustainable path toward more diversified economies, higher productivity, and better prospects for the next generation. Gender equality is a key priority for the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest. IDA is uniquely suited to support gender equality outcomes, which requires integrating work across multiple sectors and sustaining efforts over long periods. IDA works to close gender gaps by getting and keeping girls in school, helping women gain access to land titles and other vital assets, providing women with training in sustainable farming practices, and ensuring they can obtain financing to start businesses. This helps improve the economic prospects for individuals, families and whole economies.",,ABCs of IDA : Key Achievements by Country - Gender : ABCs of IDA : key achievements by country - gender,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/192481533547880872/pdf/129229-WP-ENGLISH-ida-abcs-gender-2017-PUBLIC.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/192481533547880872/text/129229-WP-ENGLISH-ida-abcs-gender-2017-PUBLIC.txt,/research/2017/10/30328390/abcs-ida-key-achievements-country-gender-abcs-ida-key-achievements-country-gender,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/192481533547880872/ABCs-of-IDA-key-achievements-by-country-gender,2017/10/30328390/abcs-ida-key-achievements-country-gender,192481533547880872,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/192481533547880872/ABCs-of-IDA-key-achievements-by-country-gender,D30328390,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cases, children may not be able to use an improved toilet or latrine - because of their age and stage of physical development or the safety concerns of their caregivers - even if their household has access to one.","Water and sanitation program,Child feces disposal country profile",Philippines - Child feces disposal,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/205361468189240657/pdf/96439-BRI-CHILD-FECES-Box391444B-PUBLIC-WSP-Philippines-CFD-Profile.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/205361468189240657/text/96439-BRI-CHILD-FECES-Box391444B-PUBLIC-WSP-Philippines-CFD-Profile.txt,/research/2015/02/24502258/philippines-child-feces-disposal,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/205361468189240657/Philippines-Child-feces-disposal,2015/05/24502258/philippines-child-feces-disposal,205361468189240657,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/205361468189240657/Philippines-Child-feces-disposal,D24502258,4,,,,Southeast Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors used a unique opportunity where CDDCs coexisted with voluntary drug treatment centres (VTCs) providing methadone in Malaysia to compare the timing and occurrence of opioid relapse (measured using urine drug testing) in individuals transitioning from CDDCs versus methadone maintenance in VTCs. Opioid-dependent individuals in CDDCs are significantly more likely to relapse to opioid use after release, and sooner, than those treated with evidence-based treatments such as methadone, suggesting that CDDCs have no role in the treatment of opioid-use disorders.",Author accepted manuscript,"Relapse to opioid use in opioid-dependent individuals released from compulsory drug detention centres compared with those from voluntary methadone treatment centres in Malaysia : a two-arm, prospective observational study",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/541741524051101092/pdf/125339-JRN-PUBLIC-Relapse-to-Opioid-Use-in-Opioid.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/541741524051101092/text/125339-JRN-PUBLIC-Relapse-to-Opioid-Use-in-Opioid.txt,/research/2017/02/29815117/relapse-opioid-use-opioid-dependent-individuals-released-compulsory-drug-detention-centres-compared-voluntary-methadone-treatment-centres-malaysia-two-arm-prospective-observational-study,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/541741524051101092/Relapse-to-opioid-use-in-opioid-dependent-individuals-released-from-compulsory-drug-detention-centres-compared-with-those-from-voluntary-methadone-treatment-centres-in-Malaysia-a-two-arm-prospective-observational-study,2017/02/29815117/relapse-opioid-use-opioid-dependent-individuals-released-compulsory-drug-detention-centres-compared-voluntary-methadone-treatment-centres-malaysia-two-arm-prospective-observational-study,541741524051101092,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/541741524051101092/Relapse-to-opioid-use-in-opioid-dependent-individuals-released-from-compulsory-drug-detention-centres-compared-with-those-from-voluntary-methadone-treatment-centres-in-Malaysia-a-two-arm-prospective-observational-study,D29815117,10,"Wegman,Martin P.","Altice,Frederick L.",,Southeast Asia,,"Kaur,Sangeeth","Rajandaran,Vanesa","Osornprasop,Sutayut","Wilson,David","Wilson,David P.","Kamarulzaman,Adeeba",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent experience in Pakistan and Indonesia favors the more local, owner-driven model; and (iv) planning for long-term reconstruction has to begin early in the recovery phase and will involve key policy decisions regarding the creation of an 'earthquake reconstruction authority' or similar agency. This note provides recommended short-term actions by the World Bank for the Government of China, within a framework of good practices in recovery and reconstruction after an earthquake. The World Bank has assisted partner governments in this regard in approximately 60 earthquakes, including most recently the 1999 Marmara (Turkey), 2001 Gujarat (India), 2004 Indian Ocean (India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand), and 2005 South Asia (Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan).

Despite China&#8217;s impressive progress in raising health standards in the 1960s and 1970s, a health divide emerged in the 1980s between poor rural areas and rich urban regions. Infant mortality rates were three times higher in rural areas and maternal mortality rates were twice as high. The problems in rural healthcare resulted from a decline in government support for public health programs, a top-down approach to health planning, and a lack of coordination between various health system levels. In the late 1990s, China, with support from the World Bank and other development partners, undertook to improve basic health services and increase healthcare accessibility for an estimated 47 million people living in poor rural areas through the Eighth Basic Health Project. The Project was set out to help China strengthen its rural health sector by upgrading rural health facilities, improving the quality and effectiveness of health service programs, and increasing the affordability of essential health care for the poor. With improved prenatal care and increased hospital delivery, maternal and infant mortality rates were nearly halved in project areas and health service utilization increased considerably among the rural poor.",Results Profile,Investing in health care for China’s rural poor : Investir pour élargir l'accès aux soins de santé aux pauvres de la Chine rurale,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/700931468179369068/pdf/96403-BRI-2012Apr16-P003566-FRENCH-China-Basic-Health-Services-Box-391427B-PUBLIC.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/700931468179369068/text/96403-BRI-2012Apr16-P003566-FRENCH-China-Basic-Health-Services-Box-391427B-PUBLIC.txt,/research/2012/04/25171539/investing-health-care-china’s-rural-poor-investir-pour-élargir-laccès-aux-soins-de-santé-aux-pauvres-de-la-chine-rurale,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/700931468179369068/Investir-pour-élargir-laccès-aux-soins-de-santé-aux-pauvres-de-la-Chine-rurale,2015/10/25171539/investing-health-care-china’s-rural-poor-investir-pour-élargir-laccès-aux-soins-de-santé-aux-pauvres-de-la-chine-rurale,700931468179369068,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/700931468179369068/Investir-pour-élargir-laccès-aux-soins-de-santé-aux-pauvres-de-la-Chine-rurale,D25171539,4,,,"Health,Central Government (Central Agencies),Compulsory health finance,Non-compulsory health finance,Sub-National Government",East Asia and Pacific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The comparison helps to identify areas where access could be enhanced. These conclusions are drawn: (1) While public investment in R&D has been more frequent for vaccines than for drugs, it has normally covered only a fraction of R&D costs. Concerted action is needed to stimulate development of innovative public health products, with public-private partnerships being a way to stimulate work towards a specific goal. (2) Drugs and vaccines face different market conditions that affect the ability to forecast demand. While for drugs, use depends on individual willingness to pay; the vaccine market depends on government willingness to pay, based on epidemiological justification for use of a product. (3) The supply landscape differs for drugs and vaccines, with fewer vaccine manufacturers. This limits competition, compared to the case of generic drug products. Strict control of the supply chain for vaccines minimizes leakage, and makes differential pricing easier to implement. (4) A joint approach to the regulatory process for drugs and vaccines will have benefits, especially as their regulation is normally controlled by a single agency within a country. Risk-benefit assessments by the US FDA do not consider global implications, creating a need for capacity to do risk-benefit assessments in developing countries. (5) Similar procurement principles could be applied to the prequalification process for drugs and vaccines. (6) Societies often undervalue prevention in health care, which impacts vaccine prices and financing. (7) Activities that enhance access to drugs will also enhance vaccine access, although the relative importance of different factors inhibiting access may differ. Both differential pricing as well as compulsory licensing may be considered.","Health, Nutrition and Population (HNP) discussion paper",Vaccines and drugs: characteristics of their use to meet public health goals,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/366961468163157397/pdf/320400MilstienVaccinesDrugsFinal.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/366961468163157397/text/320400MilstienVaccinesDrugsFinal.txt,/research/2005/03/5735382/vaccines-drugs-characteristics-use-meet-public-health-goals,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/366961468163157397/Vaccines-and-drugs-characteristics-of-their-use-to-meet-public-health-goals,2005/03/5735382/Vaccines-and-drugs-characteristics-of-their-use-to-meet-public-health-goals,366961468163157397,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/366961468163157397/Vaccines-and-drugs-characteristics-of-their-use-to-meet-public-health-goals,D5735382,40,"Batson,Amie E.","Milstien, Julie B.",,,,"Wertheimer, Albert I.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This brief provides an overview of the available data on child feces disposal in Ethiopia and concludes with ideas to strengthen safe disposal practices, based on emerging good practice. The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) tracks progress toward the Millennium Development Goal 7 target to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. The JMP standardized definition for an improved sanitation facility is one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact. In the latest JMP report, only a quarter (24 percent) of Ethiopia’s population had access to improved sanitation in 2012. This means that 70 million individuals in Ethiopia lacked improved sanitation in 2012; of these, 34 million practice open defecation. However, these estimates are based on the household’s primary sanitation facility, and may overlook the sanitation practices of young children. In many cases, children may not be able to use an improved toilet or latrine - because of their age and stage of physical development or the safety concerns of their caregivers - even if their household has access to one.","Water and sanitation program,Child feces disposal country profile",Ethiopia - Child feces disposal,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796231468171850623/pdf/96426-BRI-CHILD-FECES-Box391444B-PUBLIC-WSP-Ethiopia-CFD-Profile.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796231468171850623/text/96426-BRI-CHILD-FECES-Box391444B-PUBLIC-WSP-Ethiopia-CFD-Profile.txt,/research/2014/12/24497058/ethiopia-child-feces-disposal,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796231468171850623/Ethiopia-Child-feces-disposal,2015/05/24497058/ethiopia-child-feces-disposal,796231468171850623,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796231468171850623/Ethiopia-Child-feces-disposal,D24497058,4,,,,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The series to which the report belongs is an expanded and updated version of a set covering forty-five countries that was published in 2000. The fifty-six reports in the current series cover almost all Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) surveys undertaken during the period beginning in 1990 and ending with the date of the last survey for which data were publicly available as of June 2006. The report is organized in four principal parts: Parts one and two, which constitute the report's core, consist of tables presenting quintile-specific data for each HNP indicator covered from the two most recent DHS surveys available at the time of the report's publication. In each part there are three sets of tables: the first provides quintile-specific information for the total population; the second presents data separately for quintiles of females and males; the third features quintile-specific information presented separately for rural and urban residents. Each of these sets is divided into four sections: one dealing with HNP status, the second with the use of HNP services, the third with HNP-related behavior, and the fourth with other HNP status determinants. Part three provides supplementary technical information designed to help readers understand the data presented in parts one and two. This information deals with such issues as how the covered HNP indicators were defined and how the quintile-specific estimates were derived. Parts four and five present supporting tables that deal with three of the technical matters covered in part three: the size of the sample for each indicator covered; the standard error for each quintile-specific estimate in the total population; and the items used in constructing the wealth index, along with the weight assigned to each. An additional, sixth part consists of three annexes, for readers interested in applying the approach used in the report or in learning more about the other reports in this series. The first annex is an annotated bibliography containing further information about the technical issues concerning the approach used in the report, and about employing that approach to examine additional issues using DHS or other data sets. The second shows how the report's approach can be applied to monitor the distribution of benefits from other HNP programs, and provides a tool for doing so. The third annex is a list of all fifty-six countries for which reports are available, along with an indication of how to obtain copies of the reports dealing with them.",Country reports on HNP and poverty,"Vietnam : socio-economic differences in health, nutrition, and population",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/292211468323968651/pdf/394620vietnam01ocio0economic1optmzd.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/292211468323968651/text/394620vietnam01ocio0economic1optmzd.txt,/research/2002/01/7534966/vietnam-socio-economic-differences-health-nutrition-population,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/292211468323968651/Vietnam-socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population,2002/01/7534966/vietnam-socio-economic-differences-health-nutrition-population,292211468323968651,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/292211468323968651/Vietnam-socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population,D7534966,113,"Amouzou,Agbessi","Gwatkin,Davidson R",,,,"Johnson,Kiersten Blair","Suliman,Eldaw Abdalla","Wagstaff,Robert Adam Stephen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The source of data is the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) program, a large, multi-country household survey project. The figures in this and the other reports in the series draw on responses to questions about household wealth or assets included in the DHS questionnaire, which were similar for all the surveys covered. These responses served as the basis for the construction of a wealth index, which was used to rank individuals according to the index value for the household to which they belonged. The individuals were then divided into quintiles, and the mean value for each of up to approximately 120 indicators was calculated for each quintile.",Country reports on HNP and poverty,"Socio-economic differences in health, nutrition, and population : Benin 1996-2001",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/205641468228870599/pdf/394400benin0p01io0economic01public1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/205641468228870599/text/394400benin0p01io0economic01public1.txt,/research/2001/01/7544639/socio-economic-differences-health-nutrition-population-benin-1996-2001,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/205641468228870599/Socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population-Benin-1996-2001,2001/01/7544639/socio-economic-differences-health-nutrition-population-benin-1996-2001,205641468228870599,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/205641468228870599/Socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population-Benin-1996-2001,D7544639,115,"Amouzoun, Agbessi","Gwatkin,Davidson R",,West Africa,,"Johnson,Kiersten Blair","Rutstein,Shea","Suliman,Eldaw Abdalla","Wagstaff,Robert Adam Stephen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent experience in Pakistan and Indonesia favors the more local, owner-driven model; and (iv) planning for long-term reconstruction has to begin early in the recovery phase and will involve key policy decisions regarding the creation of an 'earthquake reconstruction authority' or similar agency. This note provides recommended short-term actions by the World Bank for the Government of China, within a framework of good practices in recovery and reconstruction after an earthquake. The World Bank has assisted partner governments in this regard in approximately 60 earthquakes, including most recently the 1999 Marmara (Turkey), 2001 Gujarat (India), 2004 Indian Ocean (India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand), and 2005 South Asia (Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan).

Some lessons learned included: first, there is no avoiding conditionality. Good practice principles of policy-based lending are now routinely stated in almost every operation and have become second nature in designing policy-based operations. Donors should reinforce government ownership by supporting rather than duplicating government processes (aid harmonization among donors, alignment of aid with the budget cycle, use of government procurement processes, etc.). There should be an accountability framework that guides both government and donors. Prior Actions (as conditions of disbursement) should be few but critical to the achievement of agreed results. Progress reviews should be transparent and conducive to performance-based, predictable budget support. Second, unlike investment lending operations, PRSCs are able, in principle, to deal with complex cross-cutting issues when the Government has the requisite technical and coordination capacities and the operations are supplemented by sector Investment Loans (ILs), Technical Assistance (TA) and competent analytical work. If the coordination and technical capacities are limited, interventions in complex cross-cutting areas have to be prioritized and sequenced. Over time, as capacities get stronger, the number of complex interventions can be increased. This is an area in which wishful thinking often replaces hard-nosed realism, and results in less than acceptable outcomes. Third, committed political leadership makes a difference. Yet, even the best leadership can only accomplish so much in a given time period. It must overcome ever-present vested interests, old mind-sets and ingrained behaviors, even assuming that technical and organizational capacities are adequate. This is a tricky area. There are often AAA products (as was the case with a string of policy notes in Tanzania) that identify aspects of these issues and there is anecdotal evidence. But the job of transforming that knowledge into successful interventions ultimately falls to the government. The donors can at best figure out what actions are likely to succeed and back them, or decide that the government is unlikely to follow through and back off. It is extremely difficult to get that balance right. Tanzania has been no exception. Finally, measuring outcomes is important in order to increase focus and accountability. Realistic, focused monitoring frameworks that track progress over time towards ultimate objectives, concentrate the mind of government as well as the donors.",,"Tanzania - Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project : Tanzania - Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eigth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/139011468312603435/pdf/ICR17170P095500C0disclosed050140120.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/139011468312603435/text/ICR17170P095500C0disclosed050140120.txt,/projects/documents/2011/09/16270696/tanzania-fourth-poverty-reduction-support-credit-project-tanzania-fourth-fifth-sixth-seventh-eigth-poverty-reduction-support-credit-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/139011468312603435/Tanzania-Fourth-Fifth-Sixth-Seventh-and-Eigth-Poverty-Reduction-Support-Credit-Project,2011/09/16270696/tanzania-fourth-poverty-reduction-support-credit-project,139011468312603435,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/139011468312603435/Tanzania-Fourth-Fifth-Sixth-Seventh-and-Eigth-Poverty-Reduction-Support-Credit-Project,D16270696,105,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Energy Transmission and Distribution,Ports/Waterways,Other Public Administration,Other Energy and Extractives,Other Education,Rural and Inter-Urban Roads,Crops,Health,Other Industry, Trade and Services,Other Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these estimates are based on the household’s primary sanitation facility, and may overlook the sanitation practices of young children.

This brief provides an overview of the available data on child feces disposal in Tanzania and concludes with ideas to strengthen safe disposal practices, based on emerging good practice. The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) tracks progress toward the Millennium Development Goal 7 target to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. The JMP standardized definition for an “improved” sanitation facility is one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact. In the latest JMP report, 12 percent of Tanzania’s population had access to improved sanitation in 2012. This means that 42 million individuals in Tanzania lacked improved sanitation in 2012, of which 6 million practice open defecation. However, these estimates are based on the household’s primary sanitation facility, and may overlook the sanitation practices of young children. In many cases, children may not be able to use an improved toilet or latrine - because of their age and stage of physical development or the safety concerns of their caregivers - even if their household has access to one.","Water and sanitation program,Child feces disposal country profile",Tanzania - Child feces disposal,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/455821468000919135/pdf/96442-BRI-CHILD-FECES-Box391444B-PUBLIC-WSP-Tanzania-CFD-Profile.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/455821468000919135/text/96442-BRI-CHILD-FECES-Box391444B-PUBLIC-WSP-Tanzania-CFD-Profile.txt,/research/2014/11/24502473/tanzania-child-feces-disposal,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/455821468000919135/Tanzania-Child-feces-disposal,2015/05/24502473/tanzania-child-feces-disposal,455821468000919135,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/455821468000919135/Tanzania-Child-feces-disposal,D24502473,4,,,,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite China&#8217;s impressive progress in raising health standards in the 1960s and 1970s, a health divide emerged in the 1980s between poor rural areas and rich urban regions. Infant mortality rates were three times higher in rural areas and maternal mortality rates were twice as high. The problems in rural healthcare resulted from a decline in government support for public health programs, a top-down approach to health planning, and a lack of coordination between various health system levels. In the late 1990s, China, with support from the World Bank and other development partners, undertook to improve basic health services and increase healthcare accessibility for an estimated 47 million people living in poor rural areas through the Eighth Basic Health Project. The Project was set out to help China strengthen its rural health sector by upgrading rural health facilities, improving the quality and effectiveness of health service programs, and increasing the affordability of essential health care for the poor. With improved prenatal care and increased hospital delivery, maternal and infant mortality rates were nearly halved in project areas and health service utilization increased considerably among the rural poor.",Results Profile,Investing in health care for China’s rural poor,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/979291467987850119/pdf/96403-BRI-2012Apr16-P003566-CHINESE-China-Basic-Health-Services-Box-391427B-PUBLIC.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/979291467987850119/text/96403-BRI-2012Apr16-P003566-CHINESE-China-Basic-Health-Services-Box-391427B-PUBLIC.txt,/research/2012/04/25171011/investing-health-care-china’s-rural-poor,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/979291467987850119/Investing-in-health-care-for-China-s-rural-poor,2015/10/25171011/investing-health-care-china’s-rural-poor,979291467987850119,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/979291467987850119/Investing-in-health-care-for-China-s-rural-poor,D25171011,3,,,"Health,Central Government (Central Agencies),Compulsory health finance,Non-compulsory health finance,Sub-National Government",East Asia and Pacific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unsafe use and inappropriate disposal of injection materials place patients, health care workers, and entire communities at increased risk for infection and injury. In 1996, the year that the Chinese government launched its National Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) Safe Injection Plan for 1997-2000, only 30 percent of all injections were provided according to the national injection standard of one sterile syringe and one sterile needle for each injection. The Government of China, with assistance from its development partners, has made great strides in improving injection safety. The MOH has issued regulations regarding the safe disposal of medical waste, including injection materials for both immunization and other health (therapeutic) services. However, even today, use of non-sterile syringes, re-use of syringes, and unsafe disposal of syringes is not uncommon. Current financial incentives lead public health facilities to neglect less profitable preventive health care services, in general and injection safety in particular. In order to address this problem, the government should consider: (i) separate accounting systems for free immunization services and for-profit preventive care to assure appropriate use of public monies. The Government needs to clearly define the responsibility of public health care providers and regulate the allocation of public funds. Most importantly, EPI funds should not be used for the provision of for-profit health care; and (ii) establishing a specific fund for the purchase, distribution, and safe disposal of injection material for immunization services. If carefully regulated, such a fund would motivate health care providers to properly use and dispose of injection materials.",Making Injections Safe in China paper series ; no. 2004-11.,Making injections safe in China : how much will it cost and who will pay?,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/883441468746660330/text/314440Making0I10in0China11P00358910.txt,/research/2004/04/5569865/making-injections-safe-china-much-cost-pay,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/883441468746660330/Making-injections-safe-in-China-how-much-will-it-cost-and-who-will-pay,2004/04/5569865/making-injections-safe-china-much-cost-pay,883441468746660330,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/883441468746660330/Making-injections-safe-in-China-how-much-will-it-cost-and-who-will-pay,D5569865,null,"Bian, Ying","Li, Shixue","General finance sector,Health,General finance sector",East Asia and Pacific,,"Liu,Xingzhu","Meng,Qingyue","Menon,Rekha","Qu Sun, Jiangbin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The principal focus is on differences among groups of individuals defined in terms of the wealth or assets of the households where they reside. The report is organized in four principal parts. Part one constitutes the report's core, and consists of tables presenting quintile-specific data for each hnp indicator covered from the two most recent DHS surveys available at the time of the report's publication. Part two provides supplementary technical information designed to help readers understand the data presented in part one. Part three presents supporting tables that deal with three of the technical matters covered in part two: the size of the sample for each indicator covered; the standard error for each quintile-specific estimate in the total population; and the items used in constructing the wealth index, along with the weight assigned to each.

The objective of the project was to learn how to stimulate improved hand washing behaviors at large scale, sustain the activities after the project ended, and measure the impact on behavioral, health, and welfare outcomes. This learning note presents the achievements, learning, and reflections that resulted from implementing a large-scale hand washing program in Vietnam and provides recommendations for future hygiene promotion initiatives. During the four-year implementation (2006-2010), the program achieved all four of its key objectives. However, a randomized control trial (RCT) impact evaluation found no significant changes in hand washing behavior and no impact on health in children under two.

The principal focus is on differences among groups of individuals defined in terms of the wealth or assets of the households where they reside. The report is organized in four principal parts. Part one constitutes the report's core, and consists of tables presenting quintile-specific data for each hnp indicator covered from the two most recent DHS surveys available at the time of the report's publication. Part two provides supplementary technical information designed to help readers understand the data presented in part one. Part three presents supporting tables that deal with three of the technical matters covered in part two: the size of the sample for each indicator covered; the standard error for each quintile-specific estimate in the total population; and the items used in constructing the wealth index, along with the weight assigned to each.

Despite China’s impressive progress in raising health standards in the 1960s and 1970s, a health divide emerged in the 1980s between poor rural areas and rich urban regions. Infant mortality rates were three times higher in rural areas and maternal mortality rates were twice as high. The problems in rural healthcare resulted from a decline in government support for public health programs, a top-down approach to health planning, and a lack of coordination between various health system levels. In the late 1990s, China, with support from the World Bank and other development partners, undertook to improve basic health services and increase healthcare accessibility for an estimated 47 million people living in poor rural areas through the Eighth Basic Health Project. The Project was set out to help China strengthen its rural health sector by upgrading rural health facilities, improving the quality and effectiveness of health service programs, and increasing the affordability of essential health care for the poor. With improved prenatal care and increased hospital delivery, maternal and infant mortality rates were nearly halved in project areas and health service utilization increased considerably among the rural poor.",Results Profile,Investing in health care for China’s rural poor,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/482041467998210904/pdf/96403-BRI-2012Apr16-P003566-China-Basic-Health-Services-Box-391427B-PUBLIC.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/482041467998210904/text/96403-BRI-2012Apr16-P003566-China-Basic-Health-Services-Box-391427B-PUBLIC.txt,/research/2012/04/25171012/investing-health-care-china’s-rural-poor,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/482041467998210904/Investing-in-health-care-for-China-s-rural-poor,2015/10/25171012/investing-health-care-china’s-rural-poor,482041467998210904,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/482041467998210904/Investing-in-health-care-for-China-s-rural-poor,D25171012,4,,,"Health,Central Government (Central Agencies),Compulsory health finance,Non-compulsory health finance,Sub-National Government",East Asia and Pacific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, the report presents data about hnp status, service use, and related matters among individuals belonging to different socio-economic classes. The principal focus is on differences among groups of individuals defined in terms of the wealth or assets of the households where they reside. The report is organized in four principal parts. Part one constitutes the report's core, and consists of tables presenting quintile-specific data for each hnp indicator covered from the two most recent DHS surveys available at the time of the report's publication. Part two provides supplementary technical information designed to help readers understand the data presented in part one. Part three presents supporting tables that deal with three of the technical matters covered in part two: the size of the sample for each indicator covered; the standard error for each quintile-specific estimate in the total population; and the items used in constructing the wealth index, along with the weight assigned to each.

Despite China&#8217;s impressive progress in raising health standards in the 1960s and 1970s, a health divide emerged in the 1980s between poor rural areas and rich urban regions. Infant mortality rates were three times higher in rural areas and maternal mortality rates were twice as high. The problems in rural healthcare resulted from a decline in government support for public health programs, a top-down approach to health planning, and a lack of coordination between various health system levels. In the late 1990s, China, with support from the World Bank and other development partners, undertook to improve basic health services and increase healthcare accessibility for an estimated 47 million people living in poor rural areas through the Eighth Basic Health Project. The Project was set out to help China strengthen its rural health sector by upgrading rural health facilities, improving the quality and effectiveness of health service programs, and increasing the affordability of essential health care for the poor. With improved prenatal care and increased hospital delivery, maternal and infant mortality rates were nearly halved in project areas and health service utilization increased considerably among the rural poor.",Results Profile,Investing in health care for China’s rural poor : Invertir en atención de salud para los pobres de zonas rurales en China,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/941581468190761057/pdf/96403-BRI-2012Apr16-P003566-SPANISH-China-Basic-Health-Services-Box-391427B-PUBLIC.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/941581468190761057/text/96403-BRI-2012Apr16-P003566-SPANISH-China-Basic-Health-Services-Box-391427B-PUBLIC.txt,/research/2012/04/25171537/investing-health-care-china’s-rural-poor-invertir-en-atención-de-salud-para-los-pobres-de-zonas-rurales-en-china,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/941581468190761057/Invertir-en-atención-de-salud-para-los-pobres-de-zonas-rurales-en-China,2015/10/25171537/investing-health-care-china’s-rural-poor-invertir-en-atención-de-salud-para-los-pobres-de-zonas-rurales-en-china,941581468190761057,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/941581468190761057/Invertir-en-atención-de-salud-para-los-pobres-de-zonas-rurales-en-China,D25171537,4,,,"Health,Central Government (Central Agencies),Compulsory health finance,Non-compulsory health finance,Sub-National Government",East Asia and Pacific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, announced in September 2015, will include reducing premature death from NCDs, of which cancer is a substantial part. This chapter summarizes the analyses and conclusions of the 79 authors of this volume on cancer, Disease Control Priorities, 3rd edition (DCP3 Cancer), and analyzes interventions for effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, affordability, and feasibility in low- and middle-income countries. The intent is to help governments of LMICs commit to locally appropriate national cancer control strategies that will include a range of cost-effective interventions, customized to local epidemiological patterns and available funding, and to convey this commitment widely to their populations. Where affordable treatment can be provided, conveying this to the public can motivate people to seek treatment when their cancer is at an earlier, much more curable stage. Providing a package of services that addresses a large part of the cancer burden will go a long way toward helping countries reach the new NCD goals. DCP3 Cancer is one of nine planned volumes in the DCP3 series. The DCP3 package includes prevention strategies, but many cancers cannot be prevented to any great extent by available methods. Some can be treated effectively (breast and childhood cancers, for example), however, and the availability of effective treatment bolsters public confidence in the overall program (Brown and others 2006; Knaul and others 2011; Sloan and Gelband 2007). Cancer control programs can mobilize broad political support, as happened in Mexico with the addition of breast cancer and childhood cancer treatment into expanded national health insurance coverage (Knaul and others 2012).",Disease control priorities,Disease control priorities : third edition - cancer,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/547531468190151195/pdf/100382-PUB-OUO-9-Box393231B.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/547531468190151195/text/100382-PUB-OUO-9-Box393231B.txt,/research/2015/01/25189466/disease-control-priorities-third-edition-cancer,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/547531468190151195/Disease-control-priorities-third-edition-cancer,2015/01/25189466/disease-control-priorities-third-edition-cancer,547531468190151195,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/547531468190151195/Disease-control-priorities-third-edition-cancer,D25189466,363,"Horton,Susan E.","Jamison,Dean T.",,,,"Sankaranarayanan, Rengaswamy","Jha,Prabhat K.",,,,,,,,,,,"978-1-4648-0350-5,978-1-4648-0349-9,978-1-4648-0369-7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But further improvements are needed and will require that health policy makers meet four core objectives: (i) increasing access; (ii) reducing the burden of health spending on households; (iii) focusing spending on prevention and primary care and (iv) improving hospital performance and quality of care. Current health spending is biased toward costly in-patient hospital care. Correcting this bias is the single most important step Romania can take towards meeting these objectives in order to improve health outcomes and increase the welfare return on its public investment in health. This note builds on the findings and conclusions from the World Bank's most recent work on health as an input to the Bank's program of support to Romania's health sector over the next three years.,,Romania : health sector policy note,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/210721468293394998/pdf/415450ENGLISH01cy0June200701PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/210721468293394998/text/415450ENGLISH01cy0June200701PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2007/06/8737436/romania-health-sector-policy-note,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/210721468293394998/Romania-health-sector-policy-note,2007/06/8737436/Romania-health-sector-policy-note,210721468293394998,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/210721468293394998/Romania-health-sector-policy-note,D8737436,15,"Menon,Rekha","Sava,Dan Ioan",,South Eastern Europe and Balkans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any intervention involves some environmental impact and a number of such impacts have been identified to be associated with Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Program (HNPSP). MWM is the most significant issue, although there are other important issues like supply of clean/pure water, provision of proper sanitation facility, occupational safety and infection control measures, use of hazardous insecticides/pesticides and construction related environmental issues. The report attempts at a fairly comprehensive look at the present level of environmental aspects of MWM in Bangladesh.

The success of the project was mostly based on the Government commitment, particularly in fighting the incidence of tuberculosis (TB), and schistosomiasis, on the extensive focus on the technical aspects of the operation, and on the institutional framework, with careful attention to the administrative, managerial, and financial implementation of the project, enhanced by a high quality supervision. These aspects provided the framework for operational research, building capacity and providing valuable learning for program development. Moreover, the provision of incentives to health providers at the local, and dispensary levels fostered a stronger health system, which would strengthen hospital referrals to TB dispensaries, and to directly observed treatment (DOTS) practices, a valuable practice that should be replicated on a larger scale.

The project will address two major emission sources of Persistent and Organic Pollutants (POPs) in Tunisia, namely: (a) inadequate disposal of healthcare waste whose combustion is the second largest source of dioxin and furan emissions, and (b) disposal of equipment and oils contaminated with PCBs. The project objective is to promote a sound management for addressing two specific issues which will result in a significant decrease in (POPs) emissions, as well as a reduction in PCB exposure for the global environment and human health. Indeed, the goal is to resolve important health, environmental, social and economic problems, resulting from HCW and PCBs current management practices.

Improvements in health are the main social and economic benefit which planners and economists hope to achieve by investing in excreta disposal. It is therefore necessary to make available as much information as possible about the interaction between excreta and health in order that engineers and planners may make informed and rational decisions. The information that is required not only concerns the broad epidemiological issues of the impact on disease of improvements in excreta disposal, but also the ways in which particular excreta disposal and reuse technologies affect the survival and dissemination of particular pathogens. This book sets out to provide such information. It presents a distillation of available knowledge on excreta, night soil, sewage and health. The emphasis is on presenting the complex, and sometimes contradictory, evidence as clearly and concisely as possible.",,Appropriate technology for water supply and sanitation : health aspects of excreta and sullage management : a state-of-the-art review,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/929641467989573003/pdf/11508000Approp0te0of0the0art0review.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/929641467989573003/text/11508000Approp0te0of0the0art0review.txt,/research/1981/06/1561173/appropriate-technology-water-supply-sanitation-health-aspects-excreta-sullage-management-state-of-the-art-review,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/929641467989573003/Appropriate-technology-for-water-supply-and-sanitation-health-aspects-of-excreta-and-sullage-management-a-state-of-the-art-review,1981/06/1561173/appropriate-technology-water-supply-sanitation-health-aspects-excreta-sullage-management-state-of-the-art-review,929641467989573003,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/929641467989573003/Appropriate-technology-for-water-supply-and-sanitation-health-aspects-of-excreta-and-sullage-management-a-state-of-the-art-review,D1561173,318,"Feachem, Richard G.","Bradley, David J.","(Historic)Primary health, including reproductive health, child health and health",,,"Garelick,",,,,,,,,Night soil; Sewage disposal; Sanitation services; Public health; Pit latrines; Waste treatment; Sewer systems; Appropriate technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they often account for a significant share of household expenditures, especially among the poor and those facing catastrophic health shocks. And they are not always accessible, as dramatically exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. This mixed record can be linked to the workings of the pharmaceutical sector, an issue that has not received much attention in policy discussions. This paper identifies the sector’s key domestic and foreign players, and analyzes its local output, international trade, and price levels. It also documents government policies, including intellectual property rights, regulatory oversight, and public procurement. An important contribution of the paper is to show the significant scientific capacity of the region, especially in relation to biological products - including vaccines - whose intrinsic heterogeneity challenges intellectual property rights protection. Based on this diagnosis, the paper flags three sets of issues for policy makers to consider. Relatively uncontroversial measures include strengthening regulatory authorities, promoting the use of generics, and upgrading public procurement. Other areas, such as supporting R and D and regulating prices, involve tradeoffs. Finally, there are strategic choices to be made, with some countries in the region favoring stringent intellectual property rights, while others support national champions or rely on state entrepreneurship.",,"Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and the Caribbean : Players, Access, and Innovation Across Diverse Models",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/766131641877985994/pdf/Pharmaceuticals-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean-Players-Access-and-Innovation-Across-Diverse-Models.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/766131641877985994/text/Pharmaceuticals-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean-Players-Access-and-Innovation-Across-Diverse-Models.txt,/research/2022/01/33701072/pharmaceuticals-latin-america-caribbean-players-access-innovation-across-diverse-models,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/766131641877985994/Pharmaceuticals-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean-Players-Access-and-Innovation-Across-Diverse-Models,,766131641877985994,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/766131641877985994/Pharmaceuticals-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean-Players-Access-and-Innovation-Across-Diverse-Models,D33701072,62,"Vargas,Veronica","Rama,Martin G.",,,,"Singh,Rucheta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Providing continuous guidance and actively engaging in the overall policy dialogue in the sector was crucial in ensuring consistency of the messages being delivered to the government. Comprehensive and careful project design greatly facilitates project implementation. Reflecting in-kind government contribution as co-financing may lead to problems when auditing the project, consequently creating repeated issues with audit performance and acceptance of audit reports.

Some lessons learned included: in regards to project preparation, there is clear trade-offs between a fast-track approach and a more time-consuming approach based on in-depth country analysis. Even when there is international experience to draw upon to address complex development problems, every project requires an in-depth analysis to ensure that project design is based on sustainable approaches. Project designs that rely more on existing models and less on a thorough understanding of country needs and context may lead to risky projects with delays in implementation. Less preparation can result in costly project restructuring in order to use loan resources more efficiently and effectively. In order to make a more effective use of loan resources, 'virtual' pools of funding can be used by fostering a single national operational plan of which project funding is only one part, under the coordination of a national coordination entity with sufficient institutional capacity.",,Dominican Republic - HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/463231468025745136/pdf/ICR10110P071501c0Disclosed061301091.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/463231468025745136/text/ICR10110P071501c0Disclosed061301091.txt,/projects/documents/2009/03/10768762/dominican-republic-hivaids-prevention-control-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/463231468025745136/Dominican-Republic-HIV-AIDS-Prevention-and-Control-Project,2009/03/10768762/dominican-republic-hivaids-prevention-control-project,463231468025745136,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/463231468025745136/Dominican-Republic-HIV-AIDS-Prevention-and-Control-Project,D10768762,61,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Health",America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The report shows that the high number of people living with unimproved household sanitation is imposing large financial and economic costs to the Indonesian economy, not only to private individuals but also to the public and commercial sectors. This is the first study in Indonesia to compile economic evidence on a range of impacts of poor sanitation and hygiene. The results indicate that poor sanitation and hygiene have significant financial and economic costs, with major implications for the socio-economic development of Indonesia and the attainment of short-, medium- and long-term development goals. The study highlights the links between improved sanitation and several other MDG targets, including poverty, hunger reduction, gender equality, child health, access to safe drinking water, and the quality of life of slum-dwellers. The study demonstrates that poor sanitation affects everyone, but especially the poor and vulnerable, including children, women, the disabled and senior citizens. Hence, sanitation should receive greater attention from all levels of Indonesian government, and from development partners, the private sector and households. Decision makers should act now, and in a concerted way, to stimulate demand for improved sanitation and hygiene practices, at the same time increasing the opportunities for households to satisfy their demand.",Water and Sanitation Program,"Economic impacts of sanitation in Indonesia : a five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam under the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/363811468042881744/pdf/721960WSP0Box30UBLIC00esi0indonesia.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/363811468042881744/text/721960WSP0Box30UBLIC00esi0indonesia.txt,/research/2008/08/16658781/economic-impacts-sanitation-indonesia-five-country-study-conducted-cambodia-indonesia-lao-pdr-philippines-vietnam-under-economics-sanitation-initiative-esi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/363811468042881744/Economic-impacts-of-sanitation-in-Indonesia-a-five-country-study-conducted-in-Cambodia-Indonesia-Lao-PDR-the-Philippines-and-Vietnam-under-the-Economics-of-Sanitation-Initiative-ESI,2008/08/16658781/indonesia-economic-impacts-sanitation-indonesia,363811468042881744,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/363811468042881744/Economic-impacts-of-sanitation-in-Indonesia-a-five-country-study-conducted-in-Cambodia-Indonesia-Lao-PDR-the-Philippines-and-Vietnam-under-the-Economics-of-Sanitation-Initiative-ESI,D16658781,94,"Hutton,Guy",,,Southeast Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the first part is to demonstrate practical and feasible responses to the challenges faced while implementing and improving environmental management. It is hoped that the experience summarized here will enhance understanding of the importance of core environmental management and thus support the planning, budgeting and monitoring of environment management activities in the context of an inter-sectoral, integrated and coordinated operational approach. Volume one of this report titled 'Mainstreaming Environmental Management in the Health-Care Sector-Implementing Experience in India' provides a detailed analysis of the challenges and practical lessons learnt in implementing the basic standards of infection control and health care waste management in the health care sector of the second most populous country in the world. It provides recommendations for improving the existing systems and also for mainstreaming and scaling-up the larger set of environmental management issues, including water, sanitation and solid waste management, through an integrated and inter-sectoral approach. Volume two of the report-'Tool-kit for Managers' provides references and synopses of national and international guidelines on key technical issues, operational and cost parameters. It sets out relevant national laws and regulations and also the associated World Bank safeguard operational policies, along with sample monitoring and supervision templates and guidance on technology and construction management.",,Mainstreaming environmental management in the health care sector in India (Vol. 2) : Tool-kit for managers,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/261021468041470125/pdf/756790v20WP0P00al0Management0Vol0II.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/261021468041470125/text/756790v20WP0P00al0Management0Vol0II.txt,/research/2012/02/17399173/mainstreaming-environmental-management-health-care-sector-india-vol-2-tool-kit-managers,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/261021468041470125/Tool-kit-for-managers,2012/02/17399173/mainstreaming-environmental-management-health-care-sector-india-vol-2-2-tool-kit-managers,261021468041470125,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/261021468041470125/Tool-kit-for-managers,D17399173,114,,,"Health,Other social services,Health,Sub-National Government,Central Government (Central Agencies)",South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estimates of HIV prevalence rates have been consistently higher among MSM than for the general population of reproductive-age men virtually wherever MSM have been well studied. Although scarce, HIV incidence data support findings of high acquisition and transmission risks among MSM in multiple contexts, cultural settings, and economic levels. Research among MSM in LMICs has been limited by the criminalization and social stigmatization of these behaviors, the safety considerations for study participants, the hidden nature of these populations, and a lack of targeted funding. Available evidence from these countries suggests that structural risks social, economic, political, or legal factors in addition to individual-level risk factors are likely to play important roles in shaping HIV risks and treatment and care options for these men. Services and resources for populations of MSM remain markedly low in many settings. They have limited coverage and access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care services with some estimates suggesting that fewer than one in ten MSM worldwide have access to the most basic package of preventive interventions.",,The Global HIV epidemics among men who have sex with men,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/312411468324578132/pdf/622610PUB0glob01476B0extop0ID018726.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/312411468324578132/text/622610PUB0glob01476B0extop0ID018726.txt,/research/2011/05/14282736/global-hiv-epidemics-among-men-sex-men,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/312411468324578132/The-Global-HIV-epidemics-among-men-who-have-sex-with-men,2011/01/14282736/global-hiv-epidemics-among-men-sex-men,312411468324578132,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/312411468324578132/The-Global-HIV-epidemics-among-men-who-have-sex-with-men,D14282736,404,"Beyrer, Chris","Wirtz, Andrea L.","Health,Other social services",,,"Walker, Damian","Johns, Benjamin","Sifakis, Frangiscos","Baral, Stefan D.",,,,,,,,,978-0-8213-8726-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are four components to the project, the first component being strengthen primary healthcare, family planning and community activities. This component will mainly finance results using Disbursement-linked Indicators (DLIs) achieved and verified by an independent verification agency (IVA) although there are specific activities under this component which will also be financed using the regular Investment Project Financing (IPF) disbursement method. This component includes four subcomponents: providing for quality services at PHCs; strengthen community health worker (CHW) program; supporting health and family planning activities; and screening for Hep C and risk factors for high burden diseases. The second component is the strengthen secondary level care. This component will strengthen the integration of services through enhancing procedures, logistics and operations that will empower hospitals to provide comprehensive quality services to the population residing in their catchment areas. Further, the component will finance the costs associated with accreditation activities as per the national accreditation guidelines for hospitals. The component will also enhance activities aiming at maintaining safe blood supply to the population to cut back on one of the highest sources of viral infection for Hep C. Lastly, the component will finance the costs associated with medical treatment of Hep C patients. This component includes three subcomponents: providing for quality services at hospitals; improve the blood bank network; and treatment of Hep C. The third component is the institutional capacity building and project management. Finally, the fourth component is the contingency emergency and response component. This component, with a provisional zero allocation, will allow for a quick reallocation of resources within the total project financing envelope to boost the country’s response in the event of a national health emergency.",,مصر - تحويل مشروع نظام الرعاية الصحية في مصر,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/569681532935067329/pdf/Egypt-Transforming-Egypts-Healthcare-System-Project.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/569681532935067329/text/Egypt-Transforming-Egypts-Healthcare-System-Project.txt,/projects/documents/2018/06/30309972/egypt-transforming-egypts-healthcare-system-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/569681532935067329/Egypt-Transforming-Egypts-Healthcare-System-Project,2018/06/30309972/egypt-transforming-egypts-healthcare-system-project-مشروع-تطوير-نظام-الرعاية-الصحية-في-مصرمن-أجل-جمهـورية-مصـــر-العربيـــة,569681532935067329,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/569681532935067329/Egypt-Transforming-Egypts-Healthcare-System-Project,D30309972,97,,,"Health,Public administration - Health,Health Facilities and Construction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on limited surveillance data, computer modeling estimates range from 70,000 to 80,000 persons with HIV, or about 0.1 percent of the adult population. Till the end of 2000, 1,549 HIV cases and 202 AIDS cases were reported to the National AIDS Control Program. Reported cases originated from surveillance of various risk group categories, screening of blood transfusions, and voluntary testing. The numbers of reported cases have been steadily rising since the late 1980s. HIV has been identified in all geographic regions of the country, including all provinces and the federally administered territories. The most important mode of transmission is sexual (mostly heterosexual) transmission, which was identified as the mode of transmission in about 42 percent of the reported cases. Exposure to infected blood or blood products accounted for 18 percent of the cases while injecting drugs accounted for about four percent. In 35 percent of the cases the mode of transmission was unknown. However, it is likely that the majority of these cases would be due to sexual transmission. So far, the great majority of infections are among males, with a male to female ratio of 7:1, which is to be expected in the early stages of an HIV epidemic. Most cases are in the age group 20-40 years. The program's current activities and the national strategic framework provide a solid platform for program expansion. At the same time, the mission is of the view that it would be desirable to set some priorities among and within the interventions included in the national strategic framework. The program needs to focus first and foremost on those interventions that can do the most to interrupt transmission, and these interventions need to be carried out on a sufficiently large scale in order to make a difference.",,Pakistan - Report of an HIV/AIDS technical review mission,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/514361468090587867/pdf/721290WP0P07480027020120Box370107B0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/514361468090587867/text/721290WP0P07480027020120Box370107B0.txt,/research/2001/05/16643511/pakistan-report-hivaids-technical-review-mission,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/514361468090587867/Pakistan-Report-of-an-HIV-AIDS-technical-review-mission,2001/05/16643511/pakistan-report-hivaids-technical-review-mission,514361468090587867,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/514361468090587867/Pakistan-Report-of-an-HIV-AIDS-technical-review-mission,D16643511,19,,,,South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Los objetivos de desarrollo del proyecto son: 1. fortalecer en el sistema federal de salud las 11 funciones esenciales de salud p&#250;blica, haciendo hincapi&#233; en 3 funciones (regulaci&#243;n, promoci&#243;n de la salud, y vigilancia y control de riesgos) para seis grupos seleccionados de enfermedades, y dando prioridad a las afecciones cr&#243;nicas no transmisibles, y el Programa Nacional de Sangre Segura. 2. Mejorar el desempe&#241;o, la eficiencia en las asignaciones y la t&#233;cnica del Programa Federal de Salud. Las lecciones aprendidas durante el transcurso del proyecto FESP I indican la necesidad de desarrollar proyectos integrales que incluyan l&#237;neas de acci&#243;n espec&#237;ficas tendientes a ampliar la extensi&#243;n de cobertura y la accesibilidad al sistema de salud de las poblaciones ind&#237;genas, mediante la implementaci&#243;n de estrategias dirigidas a mejorar el estado de salud y la calidad de vida de estas comunidades.

It is generally assumed that protection from occupational exposures requires expensive equipment which is not reasonable for resource poor healthcare services.

While non-infectious waste may be disposed of directly, all infectious and hazardous waste collected will be rendered non-infectious, non-reusable, less bulky, and aesthetically acceptable by undergoing one of the following techniques: chemical disinfection; shredding or mutilation of disposable syringes and needles, plastic IV and blood bags, catheters, rubber tuber gloves, etc. by needle and syringe destroyers and scissors; microwaving to destroy bacterial spores; incineration; or autoclaving. Treated, bio-degradable infectious waste and general waste may be dumped into an engineered landfill having these features: an impermeable layer of clay/stone masonry, a superstructure to prevent rainwater flooding, a secured mesh door, and stored earth to cover disposed waste.

The series to which the report belongs is an expanded and updated version of a set covering forty-five countries that was published in 2000. The fifty-six reports in the current series cover almost all Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) surveys undertaken during the period beginning in 1990 and ending with the date of the last survey for which data were publicly available as of June 2006. The report is organized in four principal parts: Part one, which constitutes the report's core, consists of tables presenting quintile-specific data for each HNP indicator covered from the two most recent DHS surveys available at the time of the report's publication. In each part there are three sets of tables: the first provides quintile-specific information for the total population; the second presents data separately for quintiles of females and males; the third features quintile-specific information presented separately for rural and urban residents. Each of these sets is divided into four sections: one dealing with HNP status, the second with the use of HNP services, the third with HNP-related behavior, and the fourth with other HNP status determinants. Part two provides supplementary technical information designed to help readers understand the data presented in part one. This information deals with such issues as how the covered HNP indicators were defined and how the quintile-specific estimates were derived. Part three presents supporting tables that deal with three of the technical matters covered in part two: the size of the sample for each indicator covered; the standard error for each quintile-specific estimate in the total population; and the items used in constructing the wealth index, along with the weight assigned to each. An additional, fourth part consists of three annexes, for readers interested in applying the approach used in the report or in learning more about the other reports in this series. The first annex is an annotated bibliography containing further information about the technical issues concerning the approach used in the report, and about employing that approach to examine additional issues using DHS or other data sets. The second shows how the report's approach can be applied to monitor the distribution of benefits from other HNP programs, and provides a tool for doing so. The third annex is a list of all fifty-six countries for which reports are available, along with an indication of how to obtain copies of the reports dealing with them.",Country reports on HNP and poverty,"Niger : socio-economic differences in health, nutrition, and population",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402991468137705335/pdf/394280niger00p1onomic0public1optmzd.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402991468137705335/text/394280niger00p1onomic0public1optmzd.txt,/research/1998/01/7534811/niger-socio-economic-differences-health-nutrition-population,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402991468137705335/Niger-socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population,1998/01/7534811/Niger-socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population,402991468137705335,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402991468137705335/Niger-socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population,D7534811,79,"Amouzou,Agbessi","Gwatkin,Davidson R",,,,"Johnson,Kiersten Blair","Suliman,Eldaw Abdalla","Wagstaff,Robert Adam Stephen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six countries - Kiribati, Western Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands - were visited by study teams during the July-November 1992 interval. Solomon Islands was visited in October 1993. There are sharp differences within the seven country samples in health outcomes and in underlying epidemiological conditions. Findings also indicate that these seven countries allocate varying amounts to health. Notwithstanding observed differences in health status, the seven countries have much in common in the health field. They have viewed government's roles and priorities in similar ways and have adopted comparable approaches to health service delivery and financing. By virtue of this shared paradigm and the economic and fiscal difficulties which all of the countries have experienced, they now face a common predicament as regards sustaining current health service levels and outcomes. This report outlines the main features of the prevailing health development paradigm and strategy and discusses an alternative, and possibly more effective and sustainable approach.",,Health priorities and options in the World Bank's Pacific member countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/855011492797488879/pdf/multi0page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/855011492797488879/text/multi0page.txt,/research/1994/08/734110/health-priorities-options-world-banks-pacific-member-countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/855011492797488879/Health-priorities-and-options-in-the-World-Banks-Pacific-member-countries,1994/08/734110/health-priorities-options-world-banks-pacific-member-countries,855011492797488879,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/855011492797488879/Health-priorities-and-options-in-the-World-Banks-Pacific-member-countries,D734110,398,,,"(Historic)Primary health, including reproductive health, child health and health",,,,,,,,,,,Nongovernmental organizations; Health policy; Public health; Health care delivery; Health expenditures; Family planning; Demographic indicators; Health services; Government role; Sectoral allocation; Mortality; Morbidity; Fertility; Health financing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efforts were made to determine if dietary deficiences or poor health were lowering workers' endurance and whether a nutrition intervention study was warranted. The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia and hookworm infestation is extremely high, and a significant correlation between moderate to severe anemia and reduced physical endurance, as measured by the Harvard Step Test exists. Clinical and anthropometric findings indicate that the health of most workers at the three sites was poor to fair, although good nutritional status was found in a few cases. A followup study with an iron intervention program will attempt to establish the link between anemia and endurance and productivity, and the effect of iron supplementation on physical endurance, labor productivity, and morbidity will be determined. Tabular data on the results of clinical and laboratory tests and the correlation matrices for the analyses are included.

The reform of national health systems, should strengthen national immunization programs, and facilitate surveillance systems focused on routine immunization, without disregarding supplementary immunization campaigns, in order to achieve accelerated disease control initiatives. Furthermore, the note suggests the inclusion of the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations, as key participants in immunization coalitions for social mobilization, in public-private partnerships for vaccine research and development, and, in the provision of immunizations. Finally, the importance of reliable surveillance should be taken into account, to assess the overall impact of immunization systems, and identify outbreaks, areas of high-risk, and/or weak system performance.","HNP notes,Public Health at a Glance",Immunization,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/807751468350184330/pdf/multi0page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/807751468350184330/text/multi0page.txt,/research/2001/11/1662729/immunization,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/807751468350184330/Immunization,2001/11/1662729/immunization,807751468350184330,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/807751468350184330/Immunization,D1662729,4,,,"(Historic)Primary health, including reproductive health, child health and health",,,,,,,,,,,Immunization; Vaccines; Preventive health care; Disease control; Poverty incidence; Immunization costs; Cost-effectiveness; Human immunodeficiency viruses; Malaria; Burden of disease; Communicable diseases; Mortality rates; Immunization programs; Disability; Research & development; Poverty gap; Health reform; Deficiency diseases; Vaccination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two main components other than that for project coordination and performance agreements. The first increases coverage and quality of health service networks, and empowers communities by strengthening the basic health insurance program with the financing of computers, training, supervision, and external audits as well as issuing protocols for basic health interventions and implementing a systen for supervising the quality of basic health insurance activities; and providing information, education, and communication activities for indigenous peoples, pregnant women, and health advocates. This component also supports national programs for mothers and children by expanding immunization programs and quality improvements in basic health insurance programs.

Specifically, the research looked at what motivates children in this age group to adopt hygienic hand-washing and toilet practices, and how this understanding can inform the design of simple yet effective sanitation and hygiene programs in schools. Whilst school sanitation and hygiene programs have existed for a long time, there has been no common route to designing programs that have a lasting impact on hygiene behavior both for children and their homes. To develop communication programs targeted at primary school children, the first step was to gain a better general understanding of this age group, their habits, their motivations and their world.

Some lessons learned included: the use of a project executing unit not fully integrated to the Ministry of Health's core organizational configuration may undermine its active involvement in project implementation activities. Based on the experience gained during the first phase, project design made an attempt to move the implementation unit closer to the ministry's mainstream activities. This lukewarm effort did not yield meaningful results. On the contrary, most senior staff from the Ministry resented the existence of this special unit with higher salaries and easy access to the Minister. Performance Agreements became a very useful tool to consolidate a results-oriented culture. This was a powerful tool introduced by the Health Reform Program that has had a positive impact for managing decentralized health programs. One key feature was the use of a limited number of clearly defined indicators with realistic targets that helped to keep programs well-focused. Close monitoring using a consistent methodology enabled corrective actions to be taken in a timely manner. The use of revolving funds to manage the transfer of financial resources also proved a very useful tool. It is crucial to address cultural barriers created by ethnic diversity to further improve health indicators in Bolivia. Cultural diversity remains the greatest challenge for improved maternal and child health of the poor in Bolivia. The program began to bridge the cultural barrier with the use of specially tailored activities, but they need to be developed in greater depth to accommodate cultural factors. Coverage of prenatal controls and births attended by trained health personnel stagnated during the project period and cultural barriers has been mentioned as one of the critical factors to making further progress.",,Bolivia - Second Phase of the Health Sector Reform Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936421468014363449/pdf/ICR9460Bolivia10Disclosed0031061091.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936421468014363449/text/ICR9460Bolivia10Disclosed0031061091.txt,/projects/documents/2009/01/10333152/bolivia-second-phase-health-sector-reform-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936421468014363449/Bolivia-Second-Phase-of-the-Health-Sector-Reform-Project,2009/01/10333152/bolivia-second-phase-health-sector-reform-project,936421468014363449,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936421468014363449/Bolivia-Second-Phase-of-the-Health-Sector-Reform-Project,D10333152,41,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Sub-National Government,Other social services,Health,Compulsory health finance",South America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RWSSP-2 has suffered chronic implementation delays and disruptions since effectiveness in August 2009. The mid-term review of June 2011 identified actions to restore project viability, including a two-step restructuring process to adjust implementation arrangements and investment scope. A first and urgent level 2 restructuring involved the transfer of all project implementation responsibilities to a new entity, the Community Development and Investment Agency (ARIS). In charge of the project since June 20, 2011, ARIS has substantially improved implementation performance. The next restructuring step, the object of the present paper, is required to adjust the scope and objective of the project toward maximizing results within the remaining budget. The present level 1 restructuring paper is thus submitted in response to the Government's request of June 27, 2012 to process and record necessary changes in the project (i) development objective, (ii) components, (iii) results framework, (iv) available funding, (v) expenditure categories, (vi) applicable safeguard policies, and (vii) closing date. This level 1 restructuring reflects changed conditions such as (i) the reduction of the overall project budget from $18.37 million equivalent to $13.08 million equivalent following the partial withdrawal of United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) co-financing; (ii) the increase in unit costs linked to revised design standards; (iii) unexpected costs of comprehensive additional rehabilitation works in the villages of Koromdu, Temir-Kashat and Chelpek, where unsatisfactory rehabilitation took place under the RWSSP-1, as well as the need for more modest retrofits in 26 other RWSSP-1 systems; (iv) the need for more effective implementation approaches for works contracts and for hygiene and sanitation promotion activities, and (v) a growing need to strengthen the institutional framework and capacity in the sector. The restructuring is also needed to activate the involuntary resettlement safeguard policy and to accommodate a request for extension of the project closing date. The restructuring modifies the scope of the project.",,Kyrgyz Republic - Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project : restructuring,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/283491468047375655/pdf/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/283491468047375655/text/NonAsciiFileName0.txt,/projects/documents/2012/11/17086731/kyrgyz-republic-second-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project-restructuring,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/283491468047375655/Kyrgyz-Republic-Second-Rural-Water-Supply-and-Sanitation-Project-restructuring,2012/11/17086731/kyrgyz-republic-second-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project-restructuring,283491468047375655,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/283491468047375655/Kyrgyz-Republic-Second-Rural-Water-Supply-and-Sanitation-Project-restructuring,D17086731,19,,,"Public administration - Water, sanitation and flood protection,Water Supply,Sanitation",Central Asia,,,,,,,,,,,Commonwealth of Independent States,Eastern Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The series to which the report belongs is an expanded and updated version of a set covering forty-five countries that was published in 2000. The fifty-six reports in the current series cover almost all Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) surveys undertaken during the period beginning in 1990 and ending with the date of the last survey for which data were publicly available as of June 2006. The report is organized in four principal parts: Part one, which constitutes the report's core, consists of tables presenting quintile-specific data for each HNP indicator covered from the two most recent DHS surveys available at the time of the report's publication. In each part there are three sets of tables: the first provides quintile-specific information for the total population; the second presents data separately for quintiles of females and males; the third features quintile-specific information presented separately for rural and urban residents. Each of these sets is divided into four sections: one dealing with HNP status, the second with the use of HNP services, the third with HNP-related behavior, and the fourth with other HNP status determinants. Part two provides supplementary technical information designed to help readers understand the data presented in part one. This information deals with such issues as how the covered HNP indicators were defined and how the quintile-specific estimates were derived. Part three presents supporting tables that deal with three of the technical matters covered in part two: the size of the sample for each indicator covered; the standard error for each quintile-specific estimate in the total population; and the items used in constructing the wealth index, along with the weight assigned to each. An additional, fourth part consists of three annexes, for readers interested in applying the approach used in the report or in learning more about the other reports in this series. The first annex is an annotated bibliography containing further information about the technical issues concerning the approach used in the report, and about employing that approach to examine additional issues using DHS or other data sets. The second shows how the report's approach can be applied to monitor the distribution of benefits from other HNP programs, and provides a tool for doing so. The third annex is a list of all fifty-six countries for which reports are available, along with an indication of how to obtain copies of the reports dealing with them.",Country reports on HNP and poverty,"Paraguay : socio-economic differences in health, nutrition, and population",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/304351468324012512/pdf/394300paraguay1onomic0public1optmzd.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/304351468324012512/text/394300paraguay1onomic0public1optmzd.txt,/research/1990/01/7535030/paraguay-socio-economic-differences-health-nutrition-population,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/304351468324012512/Paraguay-socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population,1990/01/7535030/Paraguay-socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population,304351468324012512,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/304351468324012512/Paraguay-socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population,D7535030,79,"Gwatkin, Davidson R.","Johnson, Kiersten",,,,"Suliman, Eldaw","Wagstaff, Adam","Amouzou, Agbessi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The paper examines the challenges countries face in addressing both infectious and non-communicable diseases, and highlights examples of integrated interventions in addressing this double burden of disease. Many low- and middle-income countries are faced with a rising burden of NCDs while working to improve health outcomes to meet health-related MDGs. This dual challenge takes place in an environment of increasingly limited resources, which is why the efficient integration of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of NCDs with MDG-related activities will be, in many instances, the best option these countries will have to address such challenges. Brazil’s Family Health Program and Turkey’s Health Transformation Program provide useful examples to draw on, and have been highlighted in this paper. Both programs have demonstrated impressive results, which can serve as an impetus for countries to take action.","Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) discussion paper",Setting the stage to address the dual challenge of MDGs and NCDs,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/415841468185927995/pdf/100278-WP-setting-the-stage-Box393228B-PUBLIC.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/415841468185927995/text/100278-WP-setting-the-stage-Box393228B-PUBLIC.txt,/research/2014/05/25161147/setting-stage-address-dual-challenge-mdgs-ncds,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/415841468185927995/Setting-the-stage-to-address-the-dual-challenge-of-MDGs-and-NCDs,2015/10/25161147/setting-stage-address-dual-challenge-mdgs-ncds,415841468185927995,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/415841468185927995/Setting-the-stage-to-address-the-dual-challenge-of-MDGs-and-NCDs,D25161147,72,"Pierre-Louis, Anne Maryse","Ferl,Katharina",,,,"Wadhwani,Christina Dinh","Harnam,Neesha","Meiro-Lorenzo,Montserrat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data covers 176 countries and economies on 71 livestock diseases (30 zoonoses and 41 non-zoonotic diseases) and 8 species or groups of species (cattle, sheep and goat, swine, poultry, equidae, buffalo, cervidae, and camels). Losses due to death, destruction or slaughter were distinguished. In total, the scope of the analysis comprises about 2.7 million data points.

It is part of the second phase of a series of analytical and evaluation studies contributing to the design of an impact and process evaluation of South Africa’s National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases. The analysis was conducted by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in collaboration with the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Boston University/Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office (HE2RO), the National Department of Health of South Africa, and the World Bank. The analysis used a novel database created through probabilistic matching of routine CD4 count and viral load data to unique individuals. The report describes the proportions of individuals 15 years or older who initiated antiretroviral therapy between 2010 and 2014 and achieved CD4 count recovery to 200, 350 and 500 cells/μl, their time to CD4 count recovery, and extent of recovery in the first 12 months of follow up. The cohort included 1,070,900 individuals (4.37 million CD4 tests). Findings suggest that among South African HIV patients under treatment, CD4 immune recovery is associated with age, sex, baseline CD4 count and viral suppression. Demographic CD4 recovery patterns can inform CD4 monitoring policies in resource-constrained settings.",,Determinants of CD4 immune recovery among individuals on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa : a national analysis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/851301474884707261/pdf/108490-REVISED-PUBLIC-CD4-Immune-Recovery-ART-SA-Report-FEB2016-coveditNov16.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/851301474884707261/text/108490-REVISED-PUBLIC-CD4-Immune-Recovery-ART-SA-Report-FEB2016-coveditNov16.txt,/research/2016/02/26815272/determinants-cd4-immune-recovery-among-individuals-antiretroviral-therapy-south-africa-national-analysis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/851301474884707261/Determinants-of-CD4-immune-recovery-among-individuals-on-antiretroviral-therapy-in-South-Africa-a-national-analysis,2016/11/26815272/determinants-cd4-immune-recovery-among-individuals-antiretroviral-therapy-south-africa-national-analysis,851301474884707261,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/851301474884707261/Determinants-of-CD4-immune-recovery-among-individuals-on-antiretroviral-therapy-in-South-Africa-a-national-analysis,D26815272,62,"Kufa-Chakezha,Tendesayi","Gita,Gloria De",,,,"Ballah,Ngormbu Jusu","Puren,Adrian","Takuva,Simba","Carmona,Sergio","MacLeod,William","Görgens,Marelize","Shubber,Zara","Fraser-Hurt,Nicole",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the global level, adolescent females 10 to 14 years of age are twice as likely to die in childbirth as adult women, and half of all new HIV infections occur in young people between 15 and 24 years of age (Pathfinder International, 2011). Young people, particularly adolescent girls and young women, continue to face challenges in meeting their SRH needs and rights, impeding their ability to contribute to the countrys development. Within this context, the World Bank conducted a quantitative and qualitative study in El Salvador to understand how the country is addressing adolescent SRH and SRHR, among 1,495 adolescents 10 to 19 years of age. The study was funded by the Nordic Development Trust Fund (NTF) within the Banks Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) Units knowledge and learning program. The study aimed to: (a) evaluate associations between adolescent SRH, human rights, and economic development among adolescents and youth; (b) assess the operational implications of integrating human rights instruments into SRH services; and (c) systematize and disseminate the results of these activities in order to support a regional and multi-sectoral dialogue on adolescent SRHR. This knowledge brief summarizes the results of this study.","Health, nutrition and population global practice knowledge brief",Adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights in El Salvador,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/503761468273626655/pdf/931000BRI0Box30ights0in0El0Salvador.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/503761468273626655/text/931000BRI0Box30ights0in0El0Salvador.txt,/research/2014/12/23009189/adolescent-sexual-reproductive-health-rights-el-salvador,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/503761468273626655/Adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights-in-El-Salvador,2014/12/23009189/adolescent-sexual-reproductive-health-rights-el-salvador,503761468273626655,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/503761468273626655/Adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights-in-El-Salvador,D23009189,4,"Cortez,Rafael A.",,,Central America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A unique feature of the SDI surveys is that it examines the production of health services at the frontline. The production of health services requires three dimensions of service delivery: (i) the availability of key inputs such as drugs, equipment and infrastructure; (ii) providers who are skilled; and (iii) providers who exert the necessary effort in applying their knowledge and skills. Successful service delivery requires that all these elements be present in the same facility at the same time. While many data sources provide information on the average availability of these elements across the health sector, the SDI surveys allow for the assessment of how these elements come together to produce quality health services in the same facility simultaneously.",,Africa - Health service delivery in Mozambique : results of 2014 service delivery indicator survey,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/595421665004275585/pdf/Africa-Health-service-delivery-in-Mozambique-results-of-2014-service-delivery-indicator-survey.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/595421665004275585/text/Africa-Health-service-delivery-in-Mozambique-results-of-2014-service-delivery-indicator-survey.txt,/research/2016/06/26524266/africa-health-service-delivery-mozambique-results-2014-service-delivery-indicator-survey,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/595421665004275585/Africa-Health-service-delivery-in-Mozambique-results-of-2014-service-delivery-indicator-survey,2016/06/26524266/Africa-Health-service-delivery-in-Mozambique-results-of-2014-service-delivery-indicator-survey,595421665004275585,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/595421665004275585/Africa-Health-service-delivery-in-Mozambique-results-of-2014-service-delivery-indicator-survey,D26524266,58,"Atakhodjaeva,Raykhona","Martin,Gayle","Health,Primary Education",Sub-Saharan Africa,,"Molina,Ezequiel","Villar Uribe,Manuela","Dastgir, Mikail","Alfano,Marco","Ozier,Owen","Ambel,Alemayehu A.","Sarker,Intissar","Matavel,Osvaldo Augusto",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project will strengthen the health system to improve service delivery, finance activities aimed at improving the management of health care waste associated with malaria control, and the environmental monitoring for impact of insecticide use, support to local capacities to effectively prevent, control and treat malaria, and, provide technical leadership for the malaria program, coordination, and implementation of said program, which includes human resource capacity strengthening. This environmental assessment and health-care waste management plan aims to improve the hygiene conditions linked to the handling and disposal of health-care wastes, and those environmental risks concerning mismanagement. The National Health-Care Waste Management Plan will ensure coordination and supervision of health care wastes at the country level, while a National Action Plan should be implemented to progressively upgrade the practices at all levels of the Health System. Moreover, legislation on the management of hazardous wastes - including other categories of hazardous wastes, such as pesticides, certain industrial wastes, etc- should be enacted, and clear, national guidelines for the management of medical wastes should be formulated. Such guidelines should complement standards on clinical policies and procedures, followed by monitoring practices. Highly infectious wastes generated in medical laboratories and isolation wards, should be chemically pre-treated in a solution of sodium hypochlorite in concentrated forms. Most importantly, the vector control policy, guidelines, protocols, and the malaria taskforce will be in place, to implement, monitor, and evaluate the integrated vector management (IVM) (V. 2), based on the assessment report on vector controls needs (V. 3).",,Zambia - Malaria Booster Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 4) : National health-care waste management plan for the year 2008 - 2010,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/212941468334891139/pdf/E12210EA0v40P01IC10HCW0FINAL0REPORT.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/212941468334891139/text/E12210EA0v40P01IC10HCW0FINAL0REPORT.txt,/projects/documents/2008/05/10783478/zambia-malaria-booster-project-environmental-assessment-vol-4-national-health-care-waste-management-plan-year-2008-2010,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/212941468334891139/National-health-care-waste-management-plan-for-the-year-2008-2010,2008/05/10783478/zambia-malaria-booster-project-environmental-assessment-vol-4-4-national-health-care-waste-management-plan-year-2008-2010,212941468334891139,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/212941468334891139/National-health-care-waste-management-plan-for-the-year-2008-2010,D10783478,94,"Govere, J.","Mbewe, Allan R.",Health,Sub-Saharan Africa,,"Mundia, Aloysius Y.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improved methods for estimating the incidence of several other diseases, including tuberculosis, maternal mortality, and chronic diseases, have also improved the reliability of health statistics. Verbal autopsy studies have linked with demographic surveillance sites, adding to our knowledge on changes in the cause-of-death composition in several countries. Notwithstanding these advances in health statistics, a theme that emerges from all the chapters in this volume is that too little is known about trends in the diseases and conditions included here in order to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of programs intended to produce better health outcomes. As we get closer to the 2015 end point of the Millennium Development Goals, reaching the goals will become increasingly challenging. The continued improvement of disease surveillance and other regularly published health information remains as important a priority for African health systems as it was for the first edition.",,Disease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa : second edition,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/431831468211449561/pdf/363050Disease0101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/431831468211449561/text/363050Disease0101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.txt,/research/2006/05/6828709/disease-mortality-sub-saharan-africa-second-edition,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/431831468211449561/Disease-and-Mortality-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-second-edition,2006/05/6828709/Disease-and-Mortality-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-second-edition,431831468211449561,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/431831468211449561/Disease-and-Mortality-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-second-edition,D6828709,414,"Bos, Eduard R.

Some South American countries, particularly Peru and Ecuador, continue to show a high number of new cases. The outbreak of the disease in previously untouched countries, such as Mexico and Guatemala, suggests further spreading into Central and North America. Environmental health precautions in Latin America and the Caribbean Region have been lax, especially with regard to the maintenance of existing water supply systems and the enormous discharge of untreated waste water in the metropolitan urban areas. Based on recent studies, the implementation of several urgent measures has been proposed. These are being implemented with the help of external donations which are being sent by many countries and international organizations. Specific areas where the Bank could give urgent advice include: a) improvements in the maintenance of safe water supply systems and safe sewage disposal; b) changes in agricultural irrigation practices; and c) changes in the output mix of agriculture towards cholera-safe products. Continued long-term analysis of the epidemiology of cholera should also be emphasized and supported. In addition, increased awareness of the central issues concerning the cholera epidemic should be integrated into ongoing and future Bank projects in the areas of population health services, public water supply, and sewage/waste disposal.","A view from LATHR,no. 15",An update on cholera in the Americas,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/864411468915042794/pdf/An-update-on-cholera-in-the-Americas.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/864411468915042794/text/An-update-on-cholera-in-the-Americas.txt,/research/1991/08/728208/update-cholera-americas,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/864411468915042794/An-update-on-cholera-in-the-Americas,1991/08/728208/,864411468915042794,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/864411468915042794/An-update-on-cholera-in-the-Americas,D728208,9,"Mardones,Francisco",,Nutrition,,,,,,,,,,,water supply and sanitation sector;number of new cases;public water supply;cholera epidemic;water and sanitation system;quality of water supply;water supply and sewerage;safe water supply system;improvements in water supply;false sense of security;public water supply system;method of excreta disposal;health care system;source of infection;chlorination of water;adequate sanitation facility;residual water;drinking water supply;Urban Water Supply;local health service;mode of transmission;sanitary excreta disposal;water treatment facility;primarily due;outbreaks of cholera;incidence of cholera;provision of latrine;environmental health condition;metropolitan urban area;municipal water system;acceptable service standards;health technology;provision of material;rural area;personal communication;untreated waste;cholera case;epidemiological study;metropolitan area;annual investment;house connection;potable water;sewage treatment;safe disposal;human life;health benefit;ambulatory treatment;food export;operations center;hepatitis a;sanitary engineer;typhoid fever;garbage disposal;adequate care;agriculture sector;similar way;transmitted disease;Infectious Disease;financial balance;early adulthood;cholera prevention;health educator;statistical trend;residual chlorine;epidemiological investigation;principal risk;water sample;fecal coliform;raw vegetables;enteric disease;physical losses;operational problems;clinical case;small fraction;calcium carbonate;water pollution;Sewage Disposal;sanitary sewerage;sewerage system;safe sanitation;future bank;household connection;agricultural irrigation;population health;epidemic cholera;water filtration;laboratory facility;non-governmental organization;irrigation practices;human consumption;epidemiological surveillance;contaminated water;laboratory staff;vibrio cholerae;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historically, rural residents have obtained water from rain, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and shallow wells, in some cases having to walk several kilometers to fetch it. Moreover, rural residents often rely on unhygienic open pit latrines for sanitation. As a result, intestinal and endemic diseases are rampant in many poor villages. By 2002, 868 million rural residents - 92 percent of the total-had access to improved water supplies. Of these, 57 percent had access to piped water systems, a 43 percent increase over 1985. In addition, 49 percent of rural households had sanitary latrines, 41 percent more than in 1993. Increasing rural access to safe, conveniently located water and sanitary latrines is a high priority for the Chinese government. Such investments are essential for continued poverty reduction in rural China because they dramatically improve health and living standards and promote social and economic development. The government has set ambitious targets in this regard, aiming for 95 percent of the rural population to have access to improved water supplies, 70 percent to have piped water supplies, and 65 percent to have sanitary latrines by 2010.",,Rural water supply and sanitation in China - scaling up services for the poor,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/913401468748473930/text/307750CHA0Rural0Water01see0also0307591.txt,/research/2004/05/5466474/rural-water-supply-sanitation-china-scaling-up-services-poor,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/913401468748473930/Rural-water-supply-and-sanitation-in-China-scaling-up-services-for-the-poor,2004/05/5466474/rural-water-supply-sanitation-china-scaling-up-services-poor,913401468748473930,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/913401468748473930/Rural-water-supply-and-sanitation-in-China-scaling-up-services-for-the-poor,D5466474,null,"Jiayi, Liu","Meng,Shuchen",,Asia,,"Yong, Tao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, injuries include those due to traffic accidents, which are becoming a major source of mortality and morbidity in Cambodia. NCDs are increasing in Cambodia as a result of smoking, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, and physical inactivity, all resulting in a sharp increase in the rates of obesity and high blood pressure. NCDs are affecting Cambodians in their productive years. Over half men and over a third of women dying from NCDs are younger than 60 years. The high cost of long-term health care and medicines, along with loss of income, pushes many Cambodian families deeper into poverty. It also overburdens the country's health system, constraining efforts to improve maternal and child health and tackle infectious diseases. Because of the nature of NCDs, which are rooted in multiple causes, strengthening the health system alone will not reduce the burden of NCDs. Many of the actions needed to prevent and control these diseases require the participation of numerous ministries and government agencies, as well as the private sector. For Cambodians to continue enjoying the fruits of economic growth, a strong commitment by the government, the people, and the international community is becoming increasing important. Improved coordination among all ministry of health (MOH) task forces will maximize financial and human resources and help implement priority NCDI-related interventions as part of, and not separate from, other ongoing programs. The application of the measures will benefit from clear procedures for joint planning, programming, budgeting, training, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation (M and E) of all programs.","Health, nutrition, and population (HNP) knowledge brief",Tackling NCDIs in Cambodia : an opportunity for inter - and intra-sectoral synergies,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/949031468007808011/pdf/933890BRI00P1200sectoral0synergies.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/949031468007808011/text/933890BRI00P1200sectoral0synergies.txt,/research/2014/11/23070441/tackling-ncdis-cambodia-opportunity-inter-intra-sectoral-synergies,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/949031468007808011/Tackling-NCDIs-in-Cambodia-an-opportunity-for-inter-and-intra-sectoral-synergies,2014/11/23070441/tackling-ncdis-cambodia-opportunity-inter-intra-sectoral-synergies,949031468007808011,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/949031468007808011/Tackling-NCDIs-in-Cambodia-an-opportunity-for-inter-and-intra-sectoral-synergies,D23070441,5,"Sanjoaquin, Miguel",,Health,Southeast Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the allocation of these resources for adult health, it is first necessary to improve our understanding of it. This book is an important contribution to this process. Some findings in this book were unexpected. In nearly all developing countries adult male mortality exceeds adult female mortality, even in the reproductive age range. In all countries for which adequate data exists, noncommunicable diseases are the leading causes of adult mortality. Death rates from noncommunicable diseases decline as a country develops and are lower among the better-off sections of society. Ignorance of such trends can only result in wasteful misallocation of resources. Much ignorance about adult health remains, and the authors of this collection identify important areas for further research. Although comprehensive policy prescriptions for adult health cannot be made, the authors conclude by recommending actions that every developing country should seriously consider.",,The health of adults in the developing world,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/336711468782113633/text/multi-page.txt,/research/1992/04/439288/health-adults-developing-world,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/336711468782113633/The-health-of-adults-in-the-developing-world,1992/04/439288/health-adults-developing-world,336711468782113633,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/336711468782113633/The-health-of-adults-in-the-developing-world,D439288,null,"Feachem, Richard G.A.","Kjellstrom, Tord","Primary Health, Including Reproductive Health, Chi",,,"Murray, Christopher J.L.","Phillips, Margaret A.","Over, Mead",,,,,,adult health;adult morbidity and mortality;early stage of development;School of Public Health;age structure of population;health status of mothers;exposure to risk factors;market for health care;international population;health services for children;Primary and Secondary Prevention;adult death;number of adults;illness and death;health-sector resources;health child;probability of death;reducing tobacco use;public health community;obstructive lung disease;noncommunicable diseases;informal insurance mechanism;rate of death;formal insurance mechanisms;consequences of disease;nature of health;health of individuals;number of scientists;lack of knowledge;acute respiratory infection;passive smoke exposure;health sector policy;Sexually transmitted diseases;behavioral risk factor;health care system;world population growth;decline in fertility;increase in deaths;curative health services;risk of death;food and nutrition;Oral rehydration therapies;access to information;unesco basic education;efficient resource allocation;health problem;adult population;tropical disease;health transition;Cardiovascular Disease;children's health;adult mortality;Infectious Disease;case management;Child Health;case-fatality rate;mortality level;mortality data;Death rates;Health policies;tropical medicine;adult disease;parasitic disease;alternative investment;child death;epidemiologic transition;relative increase;older adult;dependency burden;Maternal Health;mental illness;hepatitis b;health policy makers;health information;chronic disease;health condition;population level;research community;educational planning;,,,,ISBN 0-19-520879-X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This environmental assessment and health-care waste management plan aims to improve the hygiene conditions linked to the handling and disposal of health-care wastes, and those environmental risks concerning mismanagement. The National Health-Care Waste Management Plan will ensure coordination and supervision of health care wastes at the country level, while a National Action Plan should be implemented to progressively upgrade the practices at all levels of the Health System. Moreover, legislation on the management of hazardous wastes - including other categories of hazardous wastes, such as pesticides, certain industrial wastes, etc- should be enacted, and clear, national guidelines for the management of medical wastes should be formulated. Such guidelines should complement standards on clinical policies and procedures, followed by monitoring practices. Highly infectious wastes generated in medical laboratories and isolation wards, should be chemically pre-treated in a solution of sodium hypochlorite in concentrated forms. Most importantly, the vector control policy, guidelines, protocols, and the malaria taskforce will be in place, to implement, monitor, and evaluate the integrated vector management (IVM) (V. 2), based on the assessment report on vector controls needs (V. 3).",,Zambia - Malaria Booster Project : environmental assessment : National Health-Care Waste Management Plan 2004-2006,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/481561468170651850/pdf/E12210VOL-01.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/481561468170651850/text/E12210VOL-01.txt,/projects/documents/2003/06/6325703/zambia-malaria-booster-project-environmental-assessment-national-health-care-waste-management-plan-2004-2006,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/481561468170651850/National-Health-Care-Waste-Management-Plan-2004-2006,2003/06/6325703/National-Health-Care-Waste-Management-Plan-2004-2006,481561468170651850,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/481561468170651850/National-Health-Care-Waste-Management-Plan-2004-2006,D6325703,100,"Govere, J.","Mbewe, Allan R.",Health,Sub-Saharan Africa,,"Mundia, Aloysius Y.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some lessons learned includes: lack of realism and phasing in a project design and implementation in a conflict or post-conflict country can undermine the project ability to achieve its development objectives. This project undertook to cover the entire country after a conflict which left the country with weak institutional systems. Identification of some hotspots along with concentrating efforts in limited number of easily accessible provinces may have increased the chance of the project to achieve its development objectives. In a post-conflict country, swift and frequent restructuring exercises may be necessary in order to adapt the project design and implementation as the situation changes and new data become available. Strict adherence to global project frameworks can undermine undertaking necessary adjustments to adapt a project to the specific situation of a particular country. Frameworks such as MAP, Avian Influenza, and food crisis present the advantage that once the Board has approve the framework, then it become easy to expedite project. In a country with particularly weak capacity, it is imperative to have a Task Team Leader (TTL) in the field at the onset of the project and avoid frequent TTL changes. It takes at least one full year for a TTL to better understand a project in depth and therefore an additional couple of years at least are needed to ensure continuity and smooth implementation of the project. Similarly, in weak capacity environments, the Bank needs to exercise intense fiduciary oversight even when international firms have been hired to provide fiduciary services. Donor driven projects from the beginning to the end without proper incremental integration into the Government budget processes poses a substantial risk to the sustainability of development outcomes.",,"Congo, Democratic Republic of - Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936151468028478643/pdf/ICR20560P082510C0disclosed010230120.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936151468028478643/text/ICR20560P082510C0disclosed010230120.txt,/projects/documents/2011/11/15664814/congo-democratic-republic-multisectoral-hivaids-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936151468028478643/Congo-Democratic-Republic-of-Multisectoral-HIV-AIDS-Project,2011/11/15664814/democratic-republic-congo-multisectoral-hivaids-project,936151468028478643,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936151468028478643/Congo-Democratic-Republic-of-Multisectoral-HIV-AIDS-Project,D15664814,62,,,"Health,Sub-National Government,Other social services",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) tracks progress toward the Millennium Development Goal 7 target to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. The JMP standardized definition for an improved sanitation facility is one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact.1 The latest JMP report stated that 64 percent of the global population had access to improved sanitation in 2012.2 This means that 2.5 billion individuals lacked improved sanitation; of these, 1 billion practiced open defecation. However, these estimates are based on the household’s primary sanitation facility, and may overlook the disposal practices of young children feces. In many cases, children may not be able to use an improved toilet or latrine because of their age and stage of physicaldevelopment or the safety concerns of their caregivers, even if their household has access to one.",Water and Sanitation Program research brief,Management of child feces : Current disposal practices,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600831468189236297/pdf/98062-BRI-Box391500B-PUBLIC-WSP-CFD-Summary-Brief-FINAL-Web.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600831468189236297/text/98062-BRI-Box391500B-PUBLIC-WSP-CFD-Summary-Brief-FINAL-Web.txt,/research/2015/06/24775846/management-child-feces-current-disposal-practices,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600831468189236297/Management-of-child-feces-Current-disposal-practices,2015/07/24775846/management-child-feces-current-disposal-practices,600831468189236297,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/600831468189236297/Management-of-child-feces-Current-disposal-practices,D24775846,8,"Rand,Emily Christensen","Loughnan,Elizabeth Clementine",,,,"Maule,Louise","Reese, Heather",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This will be carried out by improving the immunization services and by introducing policy measures to improve vaccine quality and to ensure access of all population groups, and to add new vaccines to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI); and 2) improve the capacity of the health sector to design and implement health promotion programs to prevent and control the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and injury. This will be accomplished through policy and institutional improvements and by implementing pilot programs, including surveillance, staff training, health education and other health promotion interventions, at selected locations. The project comprises three main components: 1) immunization, which consists of four sub-components: (a) cold chain improvement; (b) health workers' training; (c) management and surveillance; and (d) information, education and communication; 2) health promotion, which will comprise the following sub-components: (a) institutional development and policy reform; (b) human resources development; (c) surveillance, especially behavioral risk factor surveillance; and (d) community-based interventions; and 3) the national-level programs.",,China - Disease Prevention Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/429131468015676166/pdf/multi0page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/429131468015676166/text/multi0page.txt,/projects/documents/1995/11/732631/china-disease-prevention-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/429131468015676166/China-Disease-Prevention-Project,1995/11/732631/china-disease-prevention-project,429131468015676166,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/429131468015676166/China-Disease-Prevention-Project,D732631,24,,,"Other Education,Other Public Administration,Health",East Asia,,,,,,,,,,"average life expectancy at birth;maternal and child health;Information, Education and Communication;Sexually Transmitted Disease;investment loan;Expanded Program on Immunization;acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;human resource development;health promotion interventions;needle and syringe;behavioral risk factor;primary health care;hepatitis b vaccine;epidemic prevention;Human Immunodeficiency Virus;annual interest rate;foreign exchange risk;economic law reform;health sector strategy;ship waste disposal;adverse environmental impact;HIV and AIDS;health promotion policies;health education program;international good practice;poor urban area;finance and planning;risk of death;health promotion strategies;transport of vaccine;cold chain equipment;environmental risk factor;intravenous drug abuse;weights and measure;public health problem;health promotion program;health promotion activities;Special Drawing Right;health promotion activity;infant mortality rate;burden of disease;obstructive lung disease;rate of death;probability of death;hepatitis b virus;case of health;health risk factors;consumption of cigarettes;prevalence of hypertension;disease prevention activities;preventive health care;spread of hiv;health service management;chronic disease;local expenditure;Infectious Disease;consultancy service;project costing;foreign expenditure;local training;immunization service;overseas training;vaccine-preventable disease;Exchange Rates;case management;Health Workers;community awareness;neonatal tetanus;surveillance system;tetanus toxoid;health budget;credit proceeds;Learning and Innovation Credit;grant basis;grace period;budgetary provision;smoking ban;adult population;improve immunization;special care;environmental aspect;market economy;effective teaching;environmental pollution;management capacity;participatory approach;industrial pollution;economic freedom;changing behavior;potential threat;primary prevention;dramatic change;grain distribution;basin flood;city health;local group;iodine deficiency;old person;disease pattern;disadvantaged area;international consultant;poverty category;mid-term evaluation;live birth;private practitioners;autonomous region;Socialist economies;preventive medicine;id number;mortality level;stakeholder involvement;safe sex;professional training;Alcohol Consumption;rural man;community health;medical education;rural woman;urban woman;technology development;financial resource;credit disbursement;direct contracting;health expenditure;foreign specialists;local specialists;clinical response;large consumer;equipment maintenance;national highway;effective strategy;healthy behavior;operations analyst;blood donation;reform measure;population group;preventive measure;general practitioner;acceptable limit;rising trend;integrated development;heart disease;adult man;Financing plans;institutional improvement;reporting requirement;local costs;sustainable limits;expenditure constraint;government health;preventive care;risk sharing;organizational arrangement;international expert;cluster survey;improved communication;international agency;communication strategy;poverty alleviation;health needs;provincial allocation;behavior change;counterpart funding;intervention programs;budgetary allocation;retroactive financing;health transition;pilot program;intersectoral collaboration;vaccine coverage;credit effectiveness;power transmission;managerial skill;behavioral factor;management improvement;sustainable system;high concentration;health trends;consultative process;inland waterway;rural population;level of policy;educational standard;absolute poverty;credit balance;Health policies;health systems;Endemic Disease;health agencies;basin water;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some lessons learned included: the project should have engaged more effectively on health system and policy issues. The Maternal and Child Health (MCH) component was designed as a response to the problems experienced in the rural system of maternal and child care following the economic reforms of the 1980s. Over time, the policy environment became more favorable, with the establishment of the New Cooperative Medical Service (NCMS) and the reduction and elimination program, and with increased government resources and attention flowed to MCH. Up to that point, the project had been primarily focused on supporting training and specific interventions, and was not well positioned to inform policy thinking on health system reform. Similarly, in the case of the Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) subcomponent, an inadequate government policy and institutional framework is widely believed to have undermined the impact of the project. The project could have done a better job on evaluation and lesson-learning. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) traditionally has not been well integrated into project design and implementation in health projects in China. Given the lack of an 'information culture,' as described by a number of technical experts, the focus for project management is more often on input rather than on expected functional capability or on the results/impacts. More attention could be devoted to process evaluation and lesson learning during project implementation, and measurement of capacity building could be more explicitly considered.",,China - Ninth Health Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/885981468215102925/pdf/ICR4800P0369531C0Disclosed051291091.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/885981468215102925/text/ICR4800P0369531C0Disclosed051291091.txt,/projects/documents/2009/04/10622096/china-ninth-health-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/885981468215102925/China-Ninth-Health-Project,2009/04/10622096/china-ninth-health-project,885981468215102925,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/885981468215102925/China-Ninth-Health-Project,D10622096,68,,,"Health,Sub-National Government",East Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The environmental impact assessment covers both countries. Resettlement plans will be implemented for displacement of households from farm lands. The impacts on biological resources include removal of vegetative cover and shade canopy increasing soil surface temperature, decreasing moisture content, killing soil organisms and increasing potential for erosion in the oil field development and along the pipeline. A buffer zone will be set up to minimize the impacts. The project will also incorporate environmental measures to avoid potential disturbance to aquatic resources from oil spills. Induced access to undisturbed wooded savanna and riverine vegetation during construction and operation may lead to reduction of natural resources. This will be mitigated by controlling unauthorized use of pipeline route during construction. Increased peak flows and sediment loads of small tributaries of drainage will be corrected by draining surface runoff to more than one tributary. Disturbances to existing local supply wells caused by continuous withdrawal of project water supplies will be reduced by staggering project water supply wells. Reduced water quality caused from wastewater discharge will be corrected by treating sanitary wastewater in compliance with the World Bank effluent guidelines.","World Development Sources, WDS 1998-4","Chad, Cameroon - Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 18)",,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/863021468769828252/text/multi-page.txt,/projects/documents/1999/05/693130/chad-cameroon-petroleum-development-pipeline-project-environmental-assessment-vol-18,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/863021468769828252/Chad-Cameroon-Petroleum-Development-and-Pipeline-Project-environmental-assessment,1999/05/693130/chad-cameroon-petroleum-development-pipeline-project-environmental-assessment-vol-18-32,863021468769828252,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/863021468769828252/Chad-Cameroon-Petroleum-Development-and-Pipeline-Project-environmental-assessment,D693130,null,ESSO Exploration and Production Chad Inc.,Dames,"Roads and highways,Telecommunications,Oil and Gas,Ports/Waterways,Railways",Sahel,,,,,,,,,,Drainage; Erosion control; Oil fields; Oil spillages; Petroleum exports; Pipelines; Resettlement; Sewerage; Soils; Vegetation; Water quality; Wells,Central Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Life expectancy is on par with countries whose incomes and health expenditures are three or more times greater. However, the recent collapse of the health system due to critical shortages of drugs and supplies and the country's uncertain economic future have raised fears that this proud achievement of the past will not survive the pressures of the transition. In fact, the threat is real. Notwithstanding its relative success in the past in providing widely accessible preventive primary care services, the health system suffers not only from short-term financial difficulties but also from fundamental structural weaknesses. This report examines the strengths and weaknesses of the health system and proposes a strategy for its survival and long-term development in the context of the larger economic transformation. The report is aimed at a dual audience of policy makers in the government of Albania, and at members of the international community who are looking for ways in which they might assist Albania through this period of transition and beyond.",,Albania - Health Sector Reform During the Transition,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/924631587635231654/pdf/Albania-Health-Sector-Reform-During-the-Transition.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/924631587635231654/text/Albania-Health-Sector-Reform-During-the-Transition.txt,/research/1992/03/31975724/albania-health-sector-reform-during-transition,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/924631587635231654/Albania-Health-Sector-Reform-During-the-Transition,,924631587635231654,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/924631587635231654/Albania-Health-Sector-Reform-During-the-Transition,D31975724,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the rapid increase in the rate of HIV infection in Eastern Europe in general, and the generally similar risk conditions for low HIV prevalence SEE populations, this commitment is timely in terms of preventing a more widespread epidemic. It should also be recognized by the World Bank as a call to action to support these countries through the application of its comparative advantage in both lending and non-lending activities. The purpose of this paper is to review the current status of the AIDS epidemics in three countries of the Sub-region (Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania - which constitute the ECC05 Country Department of the World Bank), to evaluate the approaches and strategies currently being used in each country, and to make recommendations both for government strategies and for the Bank's current and potential future involvement in relation to these strategies. The current low levels of HIV infection in SEE present a challenge in gaining recognition of the potential impact of HIV/AIDS on health systems, social structures, and individuals. Moreover, the approach to HIV/AIDS in SEE is complicated by relatively high levels of stigma against vulnerable groups (intravenous drug users [IDU], commercial sex workers [CSW], ethnic minorities such as the Roma, mobile populations, and men who have sex with men [MSM]).",,"HIV/AIDS in Southeastern Europe : case studies from Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania",,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/762991468759904301/text/multi0page.txt,/research/2003/05/2420972/hivaids-southeastern-europe-case-studies-bulgaria-croatia-romania,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/762991468759904301/HIV-AIDS-in-Southeastern-Europe-case-studies-from-Bulgaria-Croatia-and-Romania,2003/05/2420972/hivaids-southeastern-europe-case-studies-bulgaria-croatia-romania,762991468759904301,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/762991468759904301/HIV-AIDS-in-Southeastern-Europe-case-studies-from-Bulgaria-Croatia-and-Romania,D2420972,null,"Novotny, Thomas","Haazen, Dominic",(Historic)Sector not applicable,South Eastern Europe and Balkans,,"Adeyi, Olusoji",,,,,,,,HIV infections; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; Disease treatment; Epidemics; Government support for participation; Health care; Social structures; Tuberculosis; Malaria; Public education; Research; Social services; Civil society,,,,ISBN 0-8213-5483-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Available evidence suggests that in poor countries of disparate circumstances, one-fourth to one-half of all deaths of women of childbearing age result from pregnancy. In such countries, maternal mortality is generally the leading cause of death among young women, at the height of their productivity and family responsibility. In all, about 500,000 women die from pregnancy-related causes every year. Almost 300,000 of these deaths occur in South and West Asia, 150,000 in Africa, 34,000 in Latin America, 12,000 in East Asian developing countries, but only 6,000 in all developed countries. Over half of the deaths in South and West Asia and Africa and many of the Latin American deaths could be prevented with known technology at low cost. This paper outlines practical approaches, emphasizing cost-effective health and family planning measures, that can reduce maternal mortality and morbidity at a cost affordable to most developing countries.

Some of the negative impacts are include: (i) absence of HCWM plans in most medical institutions; (ii) poor or lack of segregation of healthcare waste at health facility levels; (iii) poor hygiene practices in collection, storage, transportation, treatment and final disposal of healthcare waste; (iv) indiscriminate dumping of healthcare waste into public dumpsites; (v) healthcare solid wastes are either buried or burnt at low temperature in open pits; (vi) absence of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to those who sustain needle stick injury, with increased risk of HIV, HBV & HCV infections; (vii) lack of healthcare waste management information system; (viii) lack of awareness on medical waste among health workers and the general public; (ix) lack of code of conduct and technical guidelines for safety measures; Some of the mitigation measures include: (i) ensure the protection of healthcare workers, wastes handlers, and the community from the harmful impacts of hazardous healthcare wastes and to maximize project compliance with international and national environmental regulations and best practices; (ii) purchasing restrictions to ensure the selection of less wasteful materials; (iii) ensuring good management and control practices especially in the purchase and use of pharmaceuticals; (iv) after use, waste containers should be sealed to prevent spilling during handling and transportation; (v) collection containers should never be allowed to overflow. This requires prompt and frequent collection; (vi) storage of waste may then be moved to a temporary on-site storage location; (vii) all waste bags should in-place and intact at the end of transportation; (viii) waste bags should be placed in containers (e.g. cardboard boxes or wheeled, rigid, lidded plastic or galvanized bins), before being placed directly into the transportation vehicle; (ix) demonstrate that health care waste management is being implemented according to plan and existing regulatory procedures",,Nigeria - Polio Eradication Support Project : environmental assessment : Health care waste management plan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448401525781824503/pdf/Health-care-waste-management-plan.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448401525781824503/text/Health-care-waste-management-plan.txt,/projects/documents/2018/03/29869616/nigeria-polio-eradication-support-project-environmental-assessment-health-care-waste-management-plan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448401525781824503/Health-care-waste-management-plan,2018/03/29869616/,448401525781824503,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448401525781824503/Health-care-waste-management-plan,D29869616,74,,,,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary mode of transmission are injecting drug users representing 71 percent of cases, followed by 22 percent heterosexual contacts, 3.6 percent homo-bisexual contacts, 1.4 percent blood recipients, 1 percent of vertical transmission. From 1989 to 1998 the epidemic progressed slowly with sporadic occurrences. However, even at this low level of transmission, the infection had reached all administrative regions of the country. Since 1996 the situation has changed dramatically. The number of HIV cases increased nearly three fold in 1997 compared with the previous year and accounted for 21 cases. In 2001 alone, this number reached 93. From 1998 through 2001 more than half of newly-registered HIV infection cases have been attributed to IDUs. The reports indicate that the percentage of new cases attributed to heterosexual contacts have also increased, although the absolute numbers remain small. More people (mostly women) appear to be contracting HIV through sexual transmission, suggesting a shift of the epidemic into the general population. HIV/AIDS is predominantly present in the age group of 21-35 years, while children between the ages of 5 and 15 provide a special opportunity and window of hope. In 2001, over 87 percent of all new AIDS cases are detected in the individuals of 26-35 years age group. As this is the most economically productive segment of the population, deaths in this age group cause great economic hardship to the families. Many productive years and investment in education and training is thus lost. These deaths also have significant family consequences, since most people in this age are raising young children. During the last three years three cases of HIV infection have been detected among pregnant women, and two cases of vertical transmission have been reported, thus sexual mode of transmission becomes apparent. The situation is further complicated with the transfusion of non-screened blood in case of emergencies becoming a common practice due to the failure of adequate public financing on the one hand, while the number of infected blood donors is increasing on the other.","World Bank working paper,no. 23",HIV/AIDS in Georgia : addressing the crisis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/715611468030300960/pdf/279500PAPER0HIV0aids0in0Georgia0wbwp023.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/715611468030300960/text/279500PAPER0HIV0aids0in0Georgia0wbwp023.txt,/research/2003/12/2978192/hivaids-georgia-addressing-crisis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/715611468030300960/HIV-AIDS-in-Georgia-addressing-the-crisis,2003/12/2978192/hivaids-georgia-addressing-crisis,715611468030300960,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/715611468030300960/HIV-AIDS-in-Georgia-addressing-the-crisis,D2978192,65,Ketevan Chkatarashvili,"Chawla,Mukesh",,Asia,,"Gotsadze,Tamar",,,,,,,,HIV AIDS infections; Stakeholder participation; Legal framework; Donor assistance; Civil society; Methodology; Leadership; Implementation arrangements; Resource allocation; Sex workers; HIV infections; Drug users; Technical assistance; lending; Health care; Nongovernmental organizations; Agriculture; Labor; Transport; Social security; Gender inequality,South Eastern Europe and Balkans,,,0-8213-5714-X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key potential environmental and safety issues related to the program include: (i) liquid and solid wastes generated during school construction and operation; (ii) lack of adequate measures, both at the design and construction stages, to address the schools´ vulnerabilities to natural disasters (both in new and rehabilitated schools); (iii) drinking water contamination and lack of adequate sanitation facilities; (iv) lack of education programs for children in personal hygiene and safety procedures during emergencies; (v) lack of low-cost renewable power systems in schools located in off-grid areas, resulting in an inadequate learning environment for children (excessive heat and poor lightning), and preventing the use of low-cost water decontamination techniques; and (vi) land acquisition issues. Mitigation measures include: 1) appropriate waste disposal measures should be adopted during the construction phase.

The number of HIV cases in the World Health Organization (WHO) European region continues to increase and by 2011 reached over 1.2 million individuals. Between 2006 and 2010 there has been an average of 127 newly diagnosed HIV infections each year per million people in the region. The continuing increase in new HIV cases in the European region is largely attributable to the epidemics in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (called 'East' in this report). An average of 74 and 11 newly diagnosed HIV infections per million were reported in Western Europe ('West') and in Central Europe ('Centre') between 2006 and 2010. In contrast, 273 new diagnoses per million populations were reported in the East. In those five years, new diagnoses were relatively stable in the West and Centre, but increased (by around 30 percent) in the East, with the highest rates of new diagnoses in Estonia, Russian Federation and Ukraine. It is important to note that case report data is only as robust as the HIV surveillance systems producing them.",Policy brief,HIV in the European region : using evidence to strengthen policy and programs,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/884421468035953626/pdf/781860BRI0HIV0029B00PUBLIC00RUSSIAN.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/884421468035953626/text/781860BRI0HIV0029B00PUBLIC00RUSSIAN.txt,/research/2013/01/17796562/hiv-european-region-using-evidence-strengthen-policy-programs,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/884421468035953626/HIV-in-the-European-region-using-evidence-to-strengthen-policy-and-programs,2013/01/17796562/hiv-european-region-using-evidence-strengthen-policy-programs,884421468035953626,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/884421468035953626/HIV-in-the-European-region-using-evidence-to-strengthen-policy-and-programs,D17796562,22,"Platt, Lucy","Jolley, Emma",,,,"Hope, Vivian","Latypov, Alisher","Hickson, Ford","Reynolds, Lucy","Rhodes, Tim",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CDF is an extension to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to allow the government and the country team to focus on key issues related to the societal transformation and institutional aspects of the development challenge. The Pilot will contribute to poverty reduction through the implementation of the National Action Plan and the CAS. It will bring about the integration of the development effort of all partners in Bolivia. It will also facilitate expanded partnerships, transparency, and accountability under the leadership of the government. The Pilot may result in the following risks: a) Donor coordination and working with civil society represents a challenge in Bolivia. b) The currently open public discussion and the fight against corruption could be repressed by interested parties that do not want to see the national integrity drive succeed. c) This Pilot requires profound institutional changes in the civil service. d) Change in the Bank's partners in the government could lead to a withdrawal of the commitment to results-oriented management and accountability for results.",,Bolivia - Implementing the comprehensive development framework,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/794841468769748780/text/multi-page.txt,/research/1999/05/441029/bolivia-implementing-comprehensive-development-framework,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/794841468769748780/Bolivia-Implementing-the-comprehensive-development-framework,1999/05/441029/bolivia-implementing-comprehensive-development-framework,794841468769748780,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/794841468769748780/Bolivia-Implementing-the-comprehensive-development-framework,D441029,null,,,Macro/Non-Trade,America,,,,,,,,,,learning and innovation loan;small and medium size enterprise;governance and public sector;civil society;contribution to poverty reduction;rural water supply coverage;economic and sector work;private sector development strategy;incidence of poverty decline;legal and regulatory framework;participation of civil society;Financial Management and Accountability;Survey of Living Conditions;Rural Water and Sanitation;transparency in government operation;ngos and civil society;finance corporation;Maternal and Child Mortality;quality of service delivery;performance benchmark;foreign direct investment;public sector operation;maternal mortality rate;national road network;inclusive economic growth;social and institutional;domestic resource mobilization;participation of parent;accountability for results;fight against corruption;current account deficit;local ngo;terms of trade;indicators of progress;partnership development;exchange rate;Exchange Rates;human development outcome;standard of living;fight against poverty;health and nutrition;external debt burden;operations and maintenance;health sector strategy;public investment program;social security reform;financial sector reform;minister of agriculture;value added tax;social investment fund;state of knowledge;local government institution;financial management specialist;human resource management;poverty reduction objective;capacity development programs;process of decentralization;judicial reform program;central government transfer;participation of communities;international donor community;senior government official;effectiveness of investments;delivery of service;integrated financial management;quality of data;health insurance system;private water concession;mother and child;technical assistance service;public expenditure program;social development program;Civil Service Reform;public sector modernization;safe water supply;improvements in access;education reform program;independent regulatory system;national integrity workshop;road maintenance fund;reducing transactions costs;success and failure;point of departure;public sector deficit;hepatitis b vaccine;maintenance of road;holistic approach;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low coverage of services poses a threat to the health and well-being of Nigerian children, but this threat becomes even more pronounced against a backdrop of the ‘health financing transition’, including the transition from support from the Gavi Alliance, the main source of financing for the country’s immunization program. The Nigeria Immunization Financing Assessment shows how the factors at multiple levels of government and the health system interact to affect four dimensions of health and immunization financing: adequacy; sustainability; efficiency; and predictability. The findings informed the design of the Nigeria Strategy for Immunization and PHC System Strengthening (NSIPSS), which will be used to guide the country as it transitions from Gavi support. This paper emphasizes the need to implement the NSIPSS in close coordination with the current reforms underway in the health sector. Currently, the government of Nigeria is piloting reforms at federal, state, and local levels to fast track implementation of the National Health Act, which aims to bring additional and ‘smarter’ domestic resources for health to the facility level. Also needed are systematic linking of health plans to budgets, more efficient allocation of resources, coordinated advocacy, exploration of demand-side barriers to service delivery, capacity building, and strengthened accountability mechanisms that ensure investments in health lead to improved health outcomes. A transition planning process that is grounded, backed by evidence, monitored and adapted regularly, and backed by the highest level of the government of Nigeria will be critical for changing the trajectory for the children of Nigeria.","Health, Nutrition and Population (HNP) Discussion Paper",Nigeria – Immunization Financing Assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/372581617945522131/pdf/Nigeria-Immunization-Financing-Assessment.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/372581617945522131/text/Nigeria-Immunization-Financing-Assessment.txt,/research/2018/06/32983984/nigeria-–-immunization-financing-assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/372581617945522131/Nigeria-Immunization-Financing-Assessment,,372581617945522131,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/372581617945522131/Nigeria-Immunization-Financing-Assessment,D32983984,68,"Alkenbrack,Sarah","Kurowski,Christoph",,Africa West,,"Hafez,Reem","Alade,Mayowa Oluwatosin","Odutolu,Ayodeji Oluwole","Ajiboye,Ayodeji Gafar","Okunola,Olumide Olaolu","Loveinsohn, Benjamin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

La evidencia disponible sugiere que en pa&#237;ses pobres con circunstancias distintas, de un cuarto a la mitad de todas las muertes de mujeres en edad de tener hijos es consecuencia del embarazo. En tales pa&#237;ses, la mortalidad materna es generalmente la causa principal de muerte entre mujeres j&#243;venes, en la plenitud de su productividad y responsabilidad familiar. En total, unas 500.000 mujeres mueren cada a&#241;o por causas relacionadas con el embarazo. Casi 300.000 de estas muertes ocurren en los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo de Asia meridional y occidental, 150.000 en &#193;frica, 34.000 en Am&#233;rica Latina, 12.000 en Asia oriental, pero solo 6.000 en todos los pa&#237;ses desarrollados.

Estimates of recent environmental trends in ECA suggest that it is necessary to focus policy initiatives, and investments even more clearly, tackling a small number of key environmental challenges in the region, namely: reducing exposure to particulates in large cities, and other urban areas with very poor air quality; phasing out the use of lead in gasoline; providing access to clean water, and basic sanitation for the rural poor in Central Asia; and, sustaining good operational, and maintenance practices in the treatment of urban drinking water supplies. Threats to human health from environmental problems in the region highlight lead and heavy metal dust from non-ferrous smelters and leaded gasoline; particulate matter (often in combination with sulfur dioxide) from burning low quality coal; nitrates in rural drinking water, especially from shallow groundwater sources; and, contamination of groundwater, and drinking water sources, with heavy metals and toxic chemicals. Trends in exposure to lead, and its impact on children in particular, is the subject of a companion paper, thus, this paper focuses primarily on the problems mentioned above.",Implementing the Environmental Action Programme for Central and Eastern Europe,Is the environment getting cleaner in Central and Eastern Europe ? selected evidence for air pollution and drinking water contamination,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/774511468771621813/text/multi0page.txt,/research/1995/10/1996446/environment-getting-cleaner-central-eastern-europe-selected-evidence-air-pollution-drinking-water-contamination,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/774511468771621813/Is-the-environment-getting-cleaner-in-Central-and-Eastern-Europe-selected-evidence-for-air-pollution-and-drinking-water-contamination,1995/10/1996446/environment-getting-cleaner-central-eastern-europe-selected-evidence-air-pollution-drinking-water-contamination,774511468771621813,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/774511468771621813/Is-the-environment-getting-cleaner-in-Central-and-Eastern-Europe-selected-evidence-for-air-pollution-and-drinking-water-contamination,D1996446,null,"Hughes, Gordon",,(Historic)Sector not applicable,,,,,,,,,,,heavy metal;quality of urban drinking water;emission per unit of output;abstraction of drinking water;contamination of drinking water;coal to gas conversion;amu darya river basin;average wage of worker;quality of drinking water;emission of particulate;emission of dust;leaded gasoline;source of pollution;drinking water supply;rural drinking water;Lead in Gasoline;environmental problem;prices for gas;maintenance of water;infant mortality rate;loss of work;incentive for farmer;household burn coal;intensive livestock production;industrial water pollution;contamination of soil;drinking water system;lack of finance;discharge of sewage;Supply of Water;survey water;water treatment facility;damage to health;total suspended particulates;air pollution problem;concentration nitrate;quality of rivers;public water supply;deep groundwater aquifer;unsafe drinking water;surface water use;poor air quality;average life expectancy;increase in mortality;exposure of child;urban traffic growth;clean drinking water;capacity of individual;ambient air quality;threats to health;chronic respiratory disease;central city area;analysis of trends;clean water supply;water supply authority;wastewater treatment plant;ambient levels;industrial production;industrial source;total emissions;urban population;stationary sources;septic tank;water supplies;shallow wells;chemical residues;sulfur dioxide;industrial emission;premature mortality;rural area;environmental condition;fertilizer use;environmental damage;Basic Sanitation;Rural Poor;organic chemical;lead exposure;environmental priority;working day;polluted areas;small cities;residential heating;respiratory complaint;dust level;health damage;health status;water quality;dust emission;premature death;environmental health;unleaded gasoline;heavy burden;water reservoir;organic material;million people;tax incentive;hepatitis a;water company;water charge;institutional change;hexavalent chromium;suspend particulate;excess mortality;oil product;monitoring data;hot spot;ambient condition;electricity production;pesticide application;financial arrangement;treated water;industrial area;primary source;financial crisis;environmental benefit;environmental performance;water utilities;agricultural chemical;economic stability;public education;water utility;wasteful use;recreational water;water control;Infectious Disease;state farm;irrigation canal;study area;polluted water;livestock operation;hepatitis virus;agricultural run;conversion factor;sewage outfall;treatment options;agricultural sector;industrial pollution;environmental regulation;city population;government action;excessive levels;exhaust gas;environmental agenda;health benefit;cleaner environment;soil chemistry;primary reason;agricultural land;water pollutant;health problem;environmental degradation;transitional economy;rapid change;environmental authority;respiratory illness;air pollutant;energy price;exposure level;petroleum product;total load;aggregate term;raw water;wastewater discharge;total consumption;private well;groundwater use;power station;lead smelter;social change;contaminated water;burning coal;social upheaval;operational practices;industrial discharge;financial resource;environmental cost;industrial supplies;common problems;organic compound;shallow groundwater;environmental factor;significant factor;risk contribution;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of HIV cases in the World Health Organization (WHO) European region continues to increase and by 2011 reached over 1.2 million individuals. Between 2006 and 2010 there has been an average of 127 newly diagnosed HIV infections each year per million people in the region. The continuing increase in new HIV cases in the European region is largely attributable to the epidemics in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (called 'East' in this report). An average of 74 and 11 newly diagnosed HIV infections per million were reported in Western Europe ('West') and in Central Europe ('Centre') between 2006 and 2010. In contrast, 273 new diagnoses per million populations were reported in the East. In those five years, new diagnoses were relatively stable in the West and Centre, but increased (by around 30 percent) in the East, with the highest rates of new diagnoses in Estonia, Russian Federation and Ukraine.

Recent experience in Pakistan and Indonesia favors the more local, owner-driven model; and (iv) planning for long-term reconstruction has to begin early in the recovery phase and will involve key policy decisions regarding the creation of an 'earthquake reconstruction authority' or similar agency. This note provides recommended short-term actions by the World Bank for the Government of China, within a framework of good practices in recovery and reconstruction after an earthquake. The World Bank has assisted partner governments in this regard in approximately 60 earthquakes, including most recently the 1999 Marmara (Turkey), 2001 Gujarat (India), 2004 Indian Ocean (India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand), and 2005 South Asia (Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan).

The main educational problems facing the Czech Roma can be summarized as follows. Majority of Romani children do not participate in pre-school education and some 60-67 percent undergo their basic education in separate provisions of special schools originally intended for mentally and physically handicapped children. Those who attend mainstream basic schools often fail and drop-out at a rate 6 times higher than non-Roma, most often in 5-9th grade. Consequently only 15 percent Romani pupils finish basic education at mainstream schools and only few continue to upper-secondary and tertiary education. As a result, Romani unemployment reaches 50-80 percent in some regions and at least 47 percent of Romani population of productive age are dependent for their income solely on social assistance. The availability of social benefits eliminates to a certain extent material deprivation and extreme poverty within the Czech Romani community, however the living standards of the majority of Roma remain very low in comparison to the population at large. Educational segregation is reinforced by increasing housing segregation.",,Czech Republic - Needs assessment study for the Roma education Fund - background paper,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/207871468032688701/pdf/352050CZ0NA0Report.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/207871468032688701/text/352050CZ0NA0Report.txt,/research/2004/09/6624722/czech-republic-needs-assessment-study-roma-education-fund-background-paper,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/207871468032688701/Czech-Republic-Needs-assessment-study-for-the-Roma-education-Fund-background-paper,2004/09/6624722/Czech-Republic-Needs-assessment-study-for-the-Roma-education-Fund-background-paper,207871468032688701,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/207871468032688701/Czech-Republic-Needs-assessment-study-for-the-Roma-education-Fund-background-paper,D6624722,96,,,,World,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alcohol abuse is responsible for 4 percent of global deaths and disability, nearly as much as tobacco and five times the burden of illicit drugs (WHO). In developing countries with low mortality, alcohol is the leading risk factor for males, causing 9.8 percent of years lost to death and disability. Alcohol abuse contributes to a wide range of social and health problems, including depression, injuries, cancer, cirrhosis, dependence, family disruption, and loss of work productivity. Health and social problems from drinking often affect others besides the drinker. While men do the bulk of the drinking worldwide, women disproportionately suffer the consequences, including alcohol related domestic violence and reduced family budgets. Heavy alcohol use takes a particular toll on the young, and has been linked to high rates of youthful criminal behavior, injury, and impaired ability to achieve educational qualifications. Many deaths and much disease and suffering could be prevented by reducing alcohol use and related problems. The most effective approach to reduce alcohol-related problems is to implement a comprehensive set of measures to reduce alcohol consumption and related problems. Policy options include price increases, restrictions on availability, strong drink-driving legislation and ready access to treatment. Some countries have succeeded in reducing per capita consumption substantially, and consequently have reduced liver cirrhosis deaths, a common indicator of alcohol-related problems in a society. Efforts to reduce alcohol consumption and related problems face formidable obstacles: alcohol dependence; social pressures; aggressive alcohol marketing and promotion; other pressing health problems competing for limited resources. The overall trend is towards stricter laws and increased enforcement in some areas such as drinking-driving. Provision of treatment for drinking problems has increased in many places in recent decades.","Public Health at a Glance,HNP notes",Alcohol,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/197651468182667049/pdf/536500BRI0ENGL10Box345621B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/197651468182667049/text/536500BRI0ENGL10Box345621B01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2003/11/11994234/alcohol,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/197651468182667049/Alcohol,2003/11/11994234/alcohol,197651468182667049,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/197651468182667049/Alcohol,D11994234,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first component is improvement of utilization and quality of health services at health facilities through performance-based financing (PBF) to strengthen public private engagements in the health sector via PBF whereby private for profit facilities will be contracted out for the provision of quality health services. It will help set the foundation for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by promoting the adoption of benefit packages at the ambulatory and hospital levels, developing a system of exemptions and waivers for health services, and adopting a provider payment system that promotes a greater number and better quality of services, and empowers communities to influence the performance of the health system. It has following sub-components: (i) provision of PBF grants to health services providers for delivery of health subprojects- minimum package of activities (MPA) and complementary package of activities (CPA), to women and children; and (ii) PBF capacity development subprojects focusing on governance, purchasing, coaching, and strengthening health administration. The second component is strengthening health financing and health policy capabilities. It aims to strengthen health care financing policy and practice in ROC both to improve equity and efficiency in health financing and to pave the way for UHC. It has following sub-components: (i) introducing fee-waivers for the poor and fee exemptions for selected services; (ii) capacity building in health policy and management; and (iii) health sector monitoring and evaluation (M and E) strengthening.",,Republic of Congo - Second Health System Strengthening Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/236521468025764060/pdf/810090PAD0P143010Box379877B00OUO090.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/236521468025764060/text/810090PAD0P143010Box379877B00OUO090.txt,/projects/documents/2013/11/18605613/republic-congo-second-health-system-strengthening-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/236521468025764060/Republic-of-Congo-Second-Health-System-Strengthening-Project,2013/11/18605613/republic-congo-second-health-system-strengthening-project,236521468025764060,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/236521468025764060/Republic-of-Congo-Second-Health-System-Strengthening-Project,D18605613,157,,,Health,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They find that fertility and mortality vary not only between religious groups, but also across caste groups. These groups also differ with respect to socio-economic status. The central finding of this paper is that despite their socio-economic disadvantages, Muslims have higher fertility than their Hindu counterparts and also exhibit lower levels of infant mortality (particularly female infant mortality). This effect is robust to the inclusion of controls for non-religious factors such as socio-economic status and area of residence. This result has important policy implications because it suggests that India's problem of ""missing women"" may be concentrated in particular groups.

The aim is to assist the Government of Egypt (GoE) in realizing the principle of social justice in the provision of healthcare. In doing so, the roadmap aims to prioritize key areas of focus for Egypt, including describing which existing programs to continue supporting and which new programs to consider for development, all under an integrated and interdependent structure. It is a focused assessment of how the overarching aim of social justice can be achieved in the healthcare sector through an emphasis on improving services for the most disadvantaged groups. This roadmap suggests recommendations that will result in incremental improvements in Egypt’s healthcare system in the short to medium term with a focus on disadvantaged groups. Achievement of these results should situate Egypt on the path to achieving social justice in healthcare in the long term.",,A roadmap to achieve social justice in health care in Egypt,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/508181468000283284/pdf/96329-WP-P132691-PUBLIC-Box391449B-Roadmap-for-SJ-in-Health-Egypt.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/508181468000283284/text/96329-WP-P132691-PUBLIC-Box391449B-Roadmap-for-SJ-in-Health-Egypt.txt,/projects/documents/2015/01/24459453/roadmap-achieve-social-justice-health-care-egypt,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/508181468000283284/A-roadmap-to-achieve-social-justice-in-health-care-in-Egypt,2015/05/24459453/roadmap-achieve-social-justice-health-care-egypt,508181468000283284,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/508181468000283284/A-roadmap-to-achieve-social-justice-in-health-care-in-Egypt,D24459453,110,"Pande,Aakanksha","Abdel-Hamid,Alaa Mahmoud Hamed","Health,Other social services",,,"Elshalakani,Amr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to improving utilization and quality of MCH services, PBF will also address the abovementioned health system challenges by improving the health financing and health policy capacities and by focusing on 1) human resources for health outcomes (motivation, distribution, etc.), 2) financial accessibility to health services, 3) availability of quality and affordable medicines; 4) community engagement, and 5) improvement of data availability. The project will have three components. Component one: Improve Utilization and Quality of Health Services at Health Facilities through Performance-Based Financing; Component two: Improve Governance, Purchasing and Coaching and Strengthen Health Administration Directorates and Services through Performance Based Financing; and Component three: Strengthen Health System Performance Financing, Health Policy, and Surveillance Capacities. Component one would be supported by IDA and the HRITF as well as through parallel funding from UNICEF, Global Fund and GAVI.

Some lessons learned included: the firm selected to provide procurement and management support not only lacked the qualifications for the job, it also lacked incentives to manage effectively. In future projects, Terms of Reference (TOR) should be upgraded to take into account and contracts for such firms should specify that payments be at least partly linked to performance such as disbursements, contract signing, and timely payments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Most of the success in Punjab could be attributed to strong ownership of the provincial government that enabled managerial autonomy with continuity of staff, and flexibility in increasing allocations for priority interventions for Internal Documents Unit (IDU). The manager, financial management (FM) and procurement staff continued to be the same individuals throughout the life of the project. Hence, staff continuity with proper administrative authority could be considered as preconditions for the relevant provinces for any future operation. In the meantime, NGO competencies and strong NGO/CBO (community based organization) leadership was another important factor for successes in Punjab. A project which is first of its kind, both in subject and in implementation modalities, must be designed in a flexible manner taking its pilot character into consideration. There should be prior agreement with the Government to make sure there is sufficient flexibility in the Government's planning process in terms of responding to a dynamic epidemic.

A large body of contemporary academic literature suggests that intellectual property rights on socially valuable goods such as essential medicines give rise to a number of ethical problems. This review paper seeks to give an overview of these problems. Moreover, it offers an outline and discussion of a number of proposals as to how these problems might be alleviated. The paper is primarily descriptive in character. This means that although a personal perspective is sometimes offered, the primary ambition of the paper is not to argue for, and defend, a particular solution to the issues discussed. The aim is rather to highlight, explain and put into perspective a number of important arguments in the debate on the ethical nature of intellectual property rights so that policy-makers and other stakeholders are relatively well-equipped to make up their own mind on the issue.",Policy Research working paper ; no.

With more than half of its territory situated above 3,000 meters, the country is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. The environmental challenges in the country, according to the recent National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) is: (i) land degradation, including deforestation, degradation of pasturelands, arable and irrigated lands; (ii) lack of improved drinking water and water quality deterioration; (iii) waste pollution from agriculture and industry; (iv) deficiencies in sewerage system infrastructure and management; (v) uncollected and untreated solid waste; (vi) environmental hazards and natural disasters caused by floods and drought; (vii) energy supply; and (viii) lack of environmental education.",,Tajikistan - Country environmental analysis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/261121468118730678/pdf/434650ESW0P1061sclosed0June01302008.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/261121468118730678/text/434650ESW0P1061sclosed0June01302008.txt,/research/2008/05/9559623/tajikistan-country-environmental-analysis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/261121468118730678/Tajikistan-Country-environmental-analysis,2008/05/9559623/Tajikistan-Country-environmental-analysis,261121468118730678,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/261121468118730678/Tajikistan-Country-environmental-analysis,D9559623,146,,,"General finance sector,General finance sector,Aviation,General finance sector,Health",Asia,,,,,,,,,,,Central Asia,Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its scope has widened since its inception to include broader issues of reproductive health, and it has recently increased attention to developing national capacity to identify and address country needs. The establishment of a worldwide network of centers collaborating in research, simultaneously contributing to fertility research and institutional development; documentation of the risks and benefits of developing country use of the most widely available contraceptives; and the introduction of two new contraceptive methods, have been its main achievements to date. This paper provides a brief overview of the factors which led the World Bank to begin providing financial support in FY1988, and of the program's accomplishments and present directions.","Policy, Research, and External Affairs working papers ; no.

In particular, it has been observed that developing countries are relatively more affected by such events, since its gross domestic product (GDP) have showed sharper declines than developed countries' ratios. On August 15, 2007, an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale shook the southern part of the central coast of Peru, with devastating consequences. Given the magnitude of the damage caused, one wonders how much less the cost of rehabilitating water and sanitation systems might have been if public investment projects and management of urban utilities (companies in charge of the water and sanitation provision), had incorporated disaster risk reduction measures. For this reason, and because this is a key public sector service for the wellbeing of population, the World Bank's water and sanitation program commissioned Apoyo Consultoria S.A.C. to conduct a research on the water and sanitation sector in order to attend the following inquiry: how much unpreparedness cost to the sector providing water and sanitation services In other words, in economic terms, what will have been the gain to society or the reconstruction savings if risk prevention measures had been included in the management of services in the sector proposed for the analysis","Water and sanitation program technical paper,WSP",Disaster risk management in water and sanitation : economic impact of the 2007 earthquake in the water and sanitation sector in four provinces of Peru - what did unpreparedness cost the country?,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/873811468070133694/pdf/632670WSP0Econ00BOX361512B00PUBLIC0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/873811468070133694/text/632670WSP0Econ00BOX361512B00PUBLIC0.txt,/research/2011/05/14572213/disaster-risk-management-water-sanitation-economic-impact-2007-earthquake-water-sanitation-sector-four-provinces-peru-unpreparedness-cost-country,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/873811468070133694/Disaster-risk-management-in-water-and-sanitation-economic-impact-of-the-2007-earthquake-in-the-water-and-sanitation-sector-in-four-provinces-of-Peru-what-did-unpreparedness-cost-the-country,2011/05/14572213/disaster-risk-management-water-sanitation-economic-impact-2007-earthquake-water-sanitation-sector-four-provinces-peru-unpreparedness-cost-country,873811468070133694,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/873811468070133694/Disaster-risk-management-in-water-and-sanitation-economic-impact-of-the-2007-earthquake-in-the-water-and-sanitation-sector-in-four-provinces-of-Peru-what-did-unpreparedness-cost-the-country,D14572213,16,"Andrade, Raul",,,South America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of health impact from environmental exposure should always be weighed against the risk of accidental infection from poor HCWM. Non-risk HCW will be placed in black polyethylene bags and either bagged for recycling or collected with other municipal waste. Hazardous HCW will be incinerated in double chamber incinerators or alternatively treated with disinfectant-autoclaving and shredding are the recommended technologies. A pit hole with a concrete lining is an alternative solution when underground waters do not risk being contaminated. Anatomical water will be collected separately and transported to a crematorium for incineration. Alternatively it can be dropped into a concrete lime pit or buried at a sufficient depth in a totally enclosed and secured location.

Some lessons learned included: The single most important characteristic of the design and implementation of the PMCHSAL was its ownership by the borrower and, in particular, by its Minister of Health (MOH). The MOH personally led the implementation of the reform program supported by the Project. The presence of such reform champion was determinant for the success of the Project. The PMCHSAL understood the importance of the provincial role in delivering health services to the poor. It explicitly looked for mechanisms to strengthen that role, respecting the provinces autonomy and increasing their institutional capacity. Expected timing between tranches and conditions do not always work out as planned. However, unexpected delays are not always necessarily bad. In the case of this Project, waiting for compliance of one third-tranche condition proved to be useful for further advancing and consolidating other project contents. Finally, the presence of a deep economic and social crisis provided a unique opportunity for advancing structural reforms that otherwise would confront unsurpassable obstacles.",,Argentina - Provincial Maternal-Child Health Sector Adjustment Loan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/686531468202183937/pdf/ICR6320ICR0P071isclosed0Feb02802008.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/686531468202183937/text/ICR6320ICR0P071isclosed0Feb02802008.txt,/projects/documents/2007/09/9047430/argentina-provincial-maternal-child-health-sector-adjustment-loan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/686531468202183937/Argentina-Provincial-Maternal-Child-Health-Sector-Adjustment-Loan,2007/09/9047430/Argentina-Provincial-Maternal-Child-Health-Sector-Adjustment-Loan,686531468202183937,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/686531468202183937/Argentina-Provincial-Maternal-Child-Health-Sector-Adjustment-Loan,D9047430,36,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Sub-National Government,Health,Compulsory health finance",South America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The country's Constitution states that access to health care is a basic right of all Guatemalans. In practice, however, it has been challenging for the Government of Guatemala to guarantee this right using public facilities. As a result, it has been trying to improve access to health services using both Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MOH) facilities and staff, and alternative health service providers, particularly nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). This case study reviews the experience implementing the Expansion of Coverage Program (Programa de Extension de Cobertura, PEC) that was established by the Government of Guatemala in 1997 to improve coverage of health and nutrition services to poor, rural, and largely indigenous areas by contracting NGOs.

In doing so, it focuses on the most vulnerable populations, addressing a basic inequity in health care. In addition, the program includes three main distinctive features: an explicit menu of health benefits, disbursements linked to achieving agreed-upon targets of enrollment and health results, and audits conducted by an independent external firm to corroborate service delivery and quality. The plan is an innovative way to strengthen health systems. Rather than simply funding more facilities and inputs or adjusting existing insurance mechanisms neither of which have been successful in dealing with the health problems of the poor, the Argentine ministry of health realized that improvements to quality and coverage of health services for the uninsured would require drastic operational changes. To do so, it decided to introduce performance incentives at all levels and to focus on results.",,Argentina - Results-based financing for health : plan nacer program,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/341291468218379309/pdf/716480WP0box370forHealthinArgentina.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/341291468218379309/text/716480WP0box370forHealthinArgentina.txt,/research/2012/07/17643460/argentina-results-based-financing-health-plan-nacer-program,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/341291468218379309/Argentina-Results-based-financing-for-health-plan-nacer-program,2012/07/17643460/argentina-results-based-financing-health-plan-nacer-program,341291468218379309,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/341291468218379309/Argentina-Results-based-financing-for-health-plan-nacer-program,D17643460,94,"Cortez, Rafael","Perez, Luis",,South America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some lessons learned included: governmental leadership/ownership is crucial to the achievement of success in large scale national programs and to ensuring that all available resources both internal and external are maximized. The establishment of well structured and unified coordination mechanisms, particularly where many agencies and sectors are involved is crucial to for successful implementation. Involvement of ministries and sectors other than health is crucial in the successful implementation of activities targeted towards diverse populations e.g. harm reduction and Anti Retroviral (ARV) treatment in the penitentiary system. It is important that treatment services begin to be decentralized so as to decrease the potentially negative impact of travel by patients to centralized treatment location may have on treatment adherence. Continuity in Bank team members working on projects is critical particularly during early project implementation when it is critical to get the project started effectively. It is important that plans for sustaining efforts started under projects are outlined from as early as project preparation, particularly when investments are made in areas that are costly. Planning for maintenance of medical equipment and infrastructure is one critical area that is often overlooked.",,Moldova - AIDS Control Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/247271468051842738/pdf/ICR9370P0741221C0Disclosed051291091.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/247271468051842738/text/ICR9370P0741221C0Disclosed051291091.txt,/projects/documents/2009/04/10621762/moldova-aids-control-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/247271468051842738/Moldova-AIDS-Control-Project,2009/04/10621762/moldova-aids-control-project,247271468051842738,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/247271468051842738/Moldova-AIDS-Control-Project,D10621762,61,,,Health,Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the additional financing is to: (i) refocus the project on priority interventions to respond to evidence on the drivers of the epidemic; (ii) scale up activities targeting higher-risk and vulnerable population groups; (iii) build capacity for sustainability and incorporate lessons of experience; and (iv) leverage additional government and donor funding and apply the Bank's global knowledge and experience. The PDO will be revised to take into account the fact that the Bank's support can make a strong contribution to the desired outcomes, but cannot claim sole responsibility given the efforts of Government and other partners. The project's results framework will be restructured in order to: (i) take account of improved sources of data that were not available at the time of the preparation of the original project, as well as areas where data availability remains limited; (ii) make the results framework more gender sensitive by disaggregating indicators to show results for men/women; (iii) clarify certain indicators to allow better measurement of the intended outcome, especially for targeted high risks and vulnerable groups; (iv) reflect the additional three years of project implementation; and (v) improve alignment with the regional HIV/AIDS scorecard.",,Congo - HIV/AIDS and Health Project : additional financing,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/238901468262531417/pdf/480560PJPR0P11101Official0Use0Only1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/238901468262531417/text/480560PJPR0P11101Official0Use0Only1.txt,/projects/documents/2009/05/10634429/congo-hivaids-health-project-additional-financing,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/238901468262531417/Congo-HIV-AIDS-and-Health-Project-additional-financing,2009/05/10634429/congo-hivaids-health-project-additional-financing,238901468262531417,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/238901468262531417/Congo-HIV-AIDS-and-Health-Project-additional-financing,D10634429,51,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Sub-National Government,Other social services,Health",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) for Indonesia is 228 but with existing programs and interventions the government does not believe it will be able to achieve its stated millennium development goal of 102 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2015. There are positive trends in an increased use of skilled birth attendants, almost universal access to some level of antenatal care and continued use of family planning but these are not enough to stem the tide of maternal death. Interventions by the skilled birth attendants in many cases are not in line with existing standards and prove to be ineffective in trying to address the emergence of complications. Antenatal care is important, but it is not where gains in decreased mortality will be obtained. The continued use of traditional birth attendants (TBA) and delivering at home are contributory factors to maternal mortality in Indonesia. In collecting data from verbal autopsies in three districts, (a widely used government initiative to determine the causes of maternal death) 63 out of 76 deaths occurred in home births that had been assisted by a TBA. In order to improve the access of the poor and the near poor to health services, the government is implementing the social insurance scheme, Jamkesmas.

The construction of these bridges will impact on the surface water quality the impact will come from the oil that may leak into the river; the construction under water will cause silts to be suspended, the loss of abandoned construction waste or construction material, construction clay mortar and domestic wastewater near construction site. In operation period, the sewage sources are mainly locomotive depot, wastewater that contains oil discharged from production sections such as vehicle section and domestic wastewater discharged from each station. The main air pollution in construction phase will be from construction dust. After implementation of the project, the existing diesel engine traction locomotives will be replaced by electric traction locomotive. Domestic waste and train waste generated from each station and section will also increase. A new environment impact, electromagnetic pollution will occur. The local land resources will definitely be impacted due to the large amount of land acquisition and removal. Following are some of the mitigation measures: (i) the railway line will be carefully selected to avoid occupying the sensitive ecosystems; (ii) the earthworks will use the excavated earth as backfill where at all possible and minimize the occupation of farmland, cultivated land, and woodlands; (iii) vertical landscaping shall be carried out on the outer sides of the railway stations; (iv) the operation of high-level noise construction shall be 200 meters far from the residential areas, and the low-level noise equipment shall be adopted. Main construction activities shall be strictly controlled within the daytime. Temporary sound-insulation facilities shall be used to decrease the effect of mechanical noise.

Some lessons learned includes: even though the project was designed to operate within the framework of the Department of Health (DOH), which used a programmatic approach and Sector Development Approach for Health (SDAH); and within these financed a selection of priority national elements which were ready for implementation, it should be noted that the project design lacked flexibility, which made it a relatively inflexible sector budget support operation. Budget support operations provide a unique opportunity to link policy dialogue with enhanced lending. The project suffered from weaknesses in Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) at all stages-design, implementation, and utilization. Efforts to identify methods for how to track the progress of certain objectives and targets were inadequate. While Bank projects are implemented solely by the Borrower, the Bank team can leverage good results through high-quality, strong, and dynamic technical support provided to the Borrower. The Bank has demonstrated the value of international 'good practices' by bringing a successful experience from the social protection sector in Latin America to apply to the Philippines' health sector.",,Philippines - National Sector Support for Health Reform Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425701468144564852/pdf/ICR22360P075460IC0disclosed02070130.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425701468144564852/text/ICR22360P075460IC0disclosed02070130.txt,/projects/documents/2013/01/17277924/philippines-national-sector-support-health-reform-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425701468144564852/Philippines-National-Sector-Support-for-Health-Reform-Project,2013/01/17277924/philippines-national-sector-support-health-reform-project,425701468144564852,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425701468144564852/Philippines-National-Sector-Support-for-Health-Reform-Project,D17277924,62,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Compulsory health finance,Health,Non-compulsory health finance",Southeast Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of this progress, a more effective framework for official development assistance (ODA) has been evolving. The international community increasingly understands and is agreeing to follow Vietnam's long-term goals and strategy, and as a result the ODA ""architecture"" - the structures and processes by which ODA is delivered and is managed - is changing. In particular, two instruments are helping to make ODA more effective. The first - the development partnership groups highlighted in this volume - have made significant progress during 2001. The second is the emerging role of the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), currently under preparation by the Government of Vietnam, and supported by Vietnam's international partners. Building upon Vietnam's ten-year Socio Economic Development Strategy, the CPRGS puts poverty at the center of Vietnam's development. Many donors are planning to use the CPRGS to underpin their assistance strategies in Vietnam. The main part of the report brings together a series of notes, prepared by many of the development partnership groups in Vietnam setting out the progress they have made in meeting development outcomes and in bringing about significant change in their sector. Groups highlighted this changed behavior by answering three 'key questions' that form the structure of the notes to be found later in this report. 1) What were the key outcomes of your partnership in the last six months 2) What significant changes have taken place, either formally or informally, as a result of your partnership 3) What are your success criteria - or milestones- for 2002 by which your partnership will monitor it is meeting its development goals This report comprises key highlights of partnership activities. The last year has seen important and substantive actions as donors and government seek to make ODA more effective. Examples range from a group of six likeminded bilateral donors (the Utstein group) who agreed in October 2001 to carry out a range of concrete steps harmonizing their procedures in ODA, (and it is likely that others will join them), to the completion of the joint Government-Donor Gender Framework. Thanks to initiatives like these, Vietnam was recognized in a major global review (2001) as putting almost all the principles of partnership into practice more effectively than other countries. This review also singled out Vietnam, along with Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda and Bolivia, from a total of 46 countries, as having made particular progress in improving aid co-ordination and moving to a new approach.",,Vietnam : Putting partnerships to work,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/419261468761726452/text/269890VN0Putting0partnerships01public1.txt,/research/2001/01/2812891/vietnam-putting-partnerships-work,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/419261468761726452/Vietnam-Putting-partnerships-to-work,2001/01/2812891/vietnam-putting-partnerships-work,419261468761726452,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/419261468761726452/Vietnam-Putting-partnerships-to-work,D2812891,null,,,,Southeast Asia,,,,,,,,,,legal needs assessment;access to reproductive health services;Public Financial Management and Accountability;natural disaster;Program for Forestry;monitoring and evaluation system;Primary and Secondary Education;Vocational and Technical Training;advancement of woman;education for all;civil society;child right;basic social service;partnership development;learning by doing;poverty reduction goal;natural disaster mitigation;civil society development;general secondary education;maternal mortality rate;eliminating gender disparity;universal primary education;international development goal;basic education program;forum for information;public expenditure reform;transparency of information;basic education strategy;donor support;donor community;legal development;development partnership;household survey;consultation workshop;gender issue;transaction cost;executive board;Gender Equality;monitoring mechanism;Social Protection;action programs;provincial agency;funding mechanism;soil erosion;pilot training;dissemination policy;executive bodies;donor representative;donor assistance;environment strategy;sampling error;international partners;rural economy;international community;environmental activity;extreme poverty;legal framework;outcome indicator;national strategic;development target;broad ownership;partnership framework;public action;participatory method;external partner;community participation;targeted program;external assistance;donor strategy;management capacity;government strategy;community group;social capital;meeting minutes;strategic objective;national assembly;living standard;international investment;gender impact;cd rom;cooperation model;mid-term evaluation;Public Services;environmental partnership;auditing requirements;Clearing houses;active participation;government representative;guiding principles;budgetary information;classroom construction;bilateral agency;multiple donor;primary focus;Funding agencies;policy work;Public Spending;teaching method;ethnic language;heavy burden;trade area;Trade Policies;poor household;chronic hunger;Trade Policy;welfare policy;targeted assistance;poverty work;learning process;watershed protection;forestry program;task forces;effective frameworks;broad consensus;resource cost;logistical support;strategy formulation;commercial bank;technical proposal;urban program;expenditure framework;wood product;trade union;National Institutions;national strategy;domestic consumption;urban stakeholders;water storage;productive use;reduced poverty;effective partnerships;economic regeneration;city strategies;forest sector;vulnerability profile;poverty alleviation;urban upgrade;hepatitis b;bare land;e-commerce initiative;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study will document the characteristics of the project's target group including: household composition, employee wages, household income levels, willingness and ability to pay, and potential uptake. The second component is the subsidy. The subsidy component will provide funding for the following output based components: 1) insurance premiums; 2) marketing; and 3) upgrading of two service providers. The third component is the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) project management. HIF will establish an implementation, monitoring and evaluation agreement with PharmAccess Foundation (PAF) govern the relationship for the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) project. The fourth component is the monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation of the insurance program by PAF consists of two activities: financial and medical reporting, and quality assurance. The fifth component is the research. The bio-medical research program is an optional component of the scheme and has been included in this proposal at the recommendation of GPOBA. It consists of medical research on the disease burden of the target population by the Center for Poverty Related Communicable Diseases (CPCD). The sixth component is the audits. Each party involved in the project will be annually audited by an independent auditor to ensure contractual compliance. The seventh component is the World Bank and GPOBA supervision.

Appropriate plans, strategies, and actions should be established to ensure adequate HC waste management (HCW) minimization at source; (2) proper segregation of waste at source generation (at each medical unit and department) is essential, efficient, and effective in managing HCW to reduce the quantity of waste requiring treatment prior to final disposal and ultimately reduces the cost of waste treatment and management; (3) it is essential to segregate sharps from other HCW at their point of generation. Sharps boxes, should be used strictly for sharps; (4) all waste bags or containers should be labelled with basic information in English and the local language of the area where the HCF is located; and (5) collection of waste is extremely important particularly to avoid over spilling of waste out of collection containers to reduce the probability of contaminated wastes coming into contact with the public.",,Nigeria - Improved Child Survival Program for Human Capital MPA Project : Environmental Assessment : Healthcare Waste Management Plan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/899791570777994811/pdf/Healthcare-Waste-Management-Plan.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/899791570777994811/text/Healthcare-Waste-Management-Plan.txt,/projects/documents/2019/10/31469734/nigeria-improved-child-survival-program-human-capital-mpa-project-environmental-assessment-healthcare-waste-management-plan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/899791570777994811/Healthcare-Waste-Management-Plan,2019/10/31469734/,899791570777994811,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/899791570777994811/Healthcare-Waste-Management-Plan,D31469734,75,"Renteria Lozano,Nigeria",,,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the Banka and Borrower received unsatisfactory ratings for their performances. The project development objective was: (i) to raise incomes, (ii) to increase access to potable water and basic sanitation; and (iii) to improve health outcomes. Activities would center on targeted areas of Alto Solimoes Region. There were five Level 2 restructurings approved by Bank Management (Country Director), resulting in cumulative extensions of the closing date totaling almost two years. There were several lessons taken from this project and are as follows: (a) the project design has to be realistic and in tune with institutional capacity and recent experiences. It also has to be flexible and adapt to adjustments in the project description, activities and financial resources. The Result Framework and the performance indicators need to be rationally linked and reviewed continuously during preparation, adapting to adjustments in design, to ensure the likelihood of achieving the intended objectives and defined targets, (b) a long preparation period should be avoided, in particular when there are significant changes in the Borrowers policies and priorities, as well as shifting economic and social conditions, (c) it is imperative to include in the original design systematic and well tested mechanisms and tools for: (i) selection of beneficiaries, (ii) subproject identification, (iii) construction of technically-sound, financially-viable and community-endorsed participatory business plans, (iv) monitoring and evaluation, (v) provision of relevant, adequate and timely technical assistance, (d) operations considering a multi-sector approach, with different institutions, target groups and set of objectives/indicators, should be extremely carefully designed and proposed only in cases of relatively more experienced borrowers with proven implementing capacity, (e) in environments where competition is likely to be limited a market study should be carried out to identify potential contractor, (f) the Bank should be more proactive in addressing weaknesses in monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design, encouraging the Government and the implementing agencies to implement an adequate M&E system early in the project life. (g) It is advisable to define a project technical assistance/extension strategy in advance. The project needs to incorporate formal partnership agreements and a component for the development of the capacities of these institutions to attend to Project demands, (h) ensuring high quality engineering designs before implementation should be the normal practice, to be able to identify the correct scope of the works and the corresponding amount of resources needed.",,Brazil - Alto Solimoes Basic Services and Sustainable Development Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/151621468017986498/pdf/Brazil-Alto-Solimoes-Basic-Services-and-Sustainable-Development-Project.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/151621468017986498/text/Brazil-Alto-Solimoes-Basic-Services-and-Sustainable-Development-Project.txt,/projects/documents/2015/03/24220824/brazil-alto-solimoes-basic-services-sustainable-development-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/151621468017986498/Brazil-Alto-Solimoes-Basic-Services-and-Sustainable-Development-Project,2015/03/24220824/Brazil-Alto-Solimoes-Basic-Services-and-Sustainable-Development-Project,151621468017986498,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/151621468017986498/Brazil-Alto-Solimoes-Basic-Services-and-Sustainable-Development-Project,D24220824,94,,,"Health,Other Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry,Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management,Sub-National Government,Other Industry, Trade and Services",South America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lessons learned from the project: the establishment of an HIV/AIDS coordinating institution, with significant decentralization within a country, is a major undertaking. Financial allocations and disbursements are necessary but insufficient conditions for successful NGO participation in the fight against HIV/AIDS. There is a need to increase funding for community level activities substantially to meet the demands created through community mobilization. Adequate emphasis needs to be given to expansion of prevention and care and support services, particularly in rural areas. Failure to establish key baseline data and to design and install a monitoring and evaluation system was a missed opportunity for creating a targeted, results-based approach. The role of HAPCO in the multi-sectoral response is crucial and needs to be strengthened. The capacity building for government agencies and civil society has been substantial and generally successful. The support for public sector entities has resulted in some remarkable successes that go beyond basic workplace interventions and the creation of awareness.",,Ethiopia - Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/370591468256198236/pdf/ICR0000065.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/370591468256198236/text/ICR0000065.txt,/projects/documents/2006/10/7195786/ethiopia-multisectoral-hivaids-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/370591468256198236/Ethiopia-Multisectoral-HIV-AIDS-Project,2006/10/7195786/Ethiopia-Multisectoral-HIV-AIDS-Project,370591468256198236,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/370591468256198236/Ethiopia-Multisectoral-HIV-AIDS-Project,D7195786,56,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Other social services,Health",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key messages of this action plan have been highlighted in the policy note, but the scope and complexity of the SPS issues as well as their critical importance to the competitiveness of Moldova's agro-food sector warranted more systematic study and strategic planning. Hence this action plan was prepared to provide information about existing gaps in Moldova's SPS management capacity and to recommend actions to address those gaps. The actions recommended are intended to bring about optimal benefits from participation in international trade while better protecting human and agricultural health in Moldova. Based on the findings of the missions and additional research conducted by consultants, a draft report was prepared in late 2005. It reviewed and analyzed government policies and institutional arrangements concerning food safety and agricultural health as well as existing technical capacities in SPS management in both the private and the public sector. As a starting point for the development of a strategic action plan for SPS management, it included priorities for public- and private-sector investment. This plan is a product of close cooperation among the Government of Moldova, local institutions, and international donor organizations. In practical terms, it provides the Moldova Republic with a strategy for capacity building to manage SPS requirements. The plan and its recommendations may be used as a basis for policymaking, priority-setting, regulatory and institutional reforms, and project investment.",,Moldova - Managing food safety and agricultural health : an action plan : Moldova - Gestioarea securitatii alimentare si a sanitatii agricole : plan de actiuni,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/914181468273929493/pdf/421400ROMANIAN1grHealthRom01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/914181468273929493/text/421400ROMANIAN1grHealthRom01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2007/01/8942516/moldova-managing-food-safety-agricultural-health-action-plan-moldova-gestioarea-securitatii-alimentare-si-sanitatii-agricole-plan-de-actiuni,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/914181468273929493/Moldova-Gestioarea-securitatii-alimentare-si-a-sanitatii-agricole-plan-de-actiuni,2007/01/8942516/moldova-managing-food-safety-agricultural-health-action-plan-moldova-gestiobarea-securitatii-alimentare-si-sanitatii-agricole-plan-de-actiuni,914181468273929493,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/914181468273929493/Moldova-Gestioarea-securitatii-alimentare-si-a-sanitatii-agricole-plan-de-actiuni,D8942516,110,,,,Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concept of 24-hour water supply, seven days a week (24/7), year round, has become so alien to our mindset, that even new supply systems are designed for less than a continuous supply. This increases the size of supply infrastructure, pushes higher coping costs on to consumers and is dissatisfying for both consumers and system operators. The benefits of continuous water supply are well-documented. However, much work is needed to understand the costs, and the operating, management, and behavioral changes, to transition successfully to a 24/7 supply system. At the request of the Government of India's Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD), and with funding from Sweden's International Development Agency (SIDA), the Water and Sanitation Program-South Asia (WSP-SA) initiated a program to assess what it would take to move to a 24/7 water supply system. Through rapid technical assessments, draft strategies were developed for Guwahati (Assam), Indore (Madhya Pradesh), and the Delhi metropolitan area. In parallel, the Government of Karnataka and the World Bank carried out distribution system diagnostics in three cities in: Karnataka, Belgaum, Gulbarga, and Hubli-Dharwad. Results of these studies were discussed in a national workshop organized by the Change Management Forum and WSP-SA in Hyderabad in September 2003.","Proceedings,Water and Sanitation Program",Fifteenth meeting of the Urban Think Tank on the 24-hour water supply : is this goal achievable?

The main task in the Maldives is to reduce the impact of use of heroin and problematic drug use by better prevention and treatment. Good prevention and treatment will help prevent HIV and other adverse health, social and criminal consequences of drug use. There are a number of structural conditions that will need to be addressed through engagement with multiple governmental ministries and departments. The main conclusions of this report will require collaboration and coordination within government and between government, civil society and the drug using (active and in recovery) community. There is a need to differentiate in law and policy and practice between different types of drug use in terms of potential harm to the individual and society. There needs to be greater separation of criminal justice and therapeutic interventions. Penalties for drug offenses are high and inflexible. Too many drug users are in prison to no obvious gain to the community - either in terms of deterrence or rehabilitation. Drug users get trapped in a penal and rehabilitation system that has the unintended consequence that rehabilitation is made harder. The lack of job opportunities for recovering drug users is a major obstacle to reintegration, across all services. There is sufficient positive evidence now to roll out the methadone maintenance program to other community sites. It is imperative the reported low level of injecting does not increase.",,A process and system evaluation of the drug treatment and rehabilitation services in the Maldives,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/805331468306290956/pdf/712880WP0P113500January020110GM0GS.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/805331468306290956/text/712880WP0P113500January020110GM0GS.txt,/research/2010/11/16518657/process-system-evaluation-drug-treatment-rehabilitation-services-maldives,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/805331468306290956/A-process-and-system-evaluation-of-the-drug-treatment-and-rehabilitation-services-in-the-Maldives,2010/11/16518657/process-system-evaluation-drug-treatment-rehabilitation-services-maldives,805331468306290956,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/805331468306290956/A-process-and-system-evaluation-of-the-drug-treatment-and-rehabilitation-services-in-the-Maldives,D16518657,52,"Mortimore, Gordon","Stimson, Gerry",Health,,,"Adam, Abdulla",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Discussions focused on issues of governance, health, poverty, equity and finance, an in particular the greater role of the private sector, and the community in managing affairs in the city, to help a progressive State Government in addressing issues of major concern. The note looks at Australia's development cooperation program in India, and with the Government of Sikkim, namely the Gangtok Urban Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project to be undertaken, which will involve the rehabilitation, and expansion of the water supply network, and address the service needs of vulnerable communities, particularly in sanitation services. On reviewing the key roles for civil society, and nongovernmental organizations in the challenges ahead, alternative views from the Think Tank suggest that, while conventionally, the idea of a strong municipality is considered a prerequisite of good governance, in thinking about effective water and sanitation supply, maybe having a municipality is not such a prerequisite, provided a strong independent body that can operate irrespective of boundaries, could be established.",Proceedings,Eleventh meeting of the Urban Think Tank on the challenge of Gangtok,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/392691468771713358/text/multi0page.txt,/research/2000/06/1743978/eleventh-meeting-urban-think-tank-challenge-gangtok,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/392691468771713358/Eleventh-meeting-of-the-Urban-Think-Tank-on-the-challenge-of-Gangtok,2000/06/1743978/eleventh-meeting-urban-think-tank-challenge-gangtok,392691468771713358,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/392691468771713358/Eleventh-meeting-of-the-Urban-Think-Tank-on-the-challenge-of-Gangtok,D1743978,null,S.W.

The moderating growth adds a new sense of urgency to strengthening human capital and ensuring that the population remains healthy and productive, especially as the economy gradually rebalances towards services and the society experiences shifting demographics and disease burdens. The lower economic growth rates open the space for much needed reforms in the health sector as the high growth rates of health expenditure in the past years may be difficult to sustain under the 'New Normal': a recent OECD study estimates that government expenditures on health and long term care in China will increase three-fold as percent of GDP over the next four decades if adequate reforms are not undertaken.

Project sustainability is rated as likely based on Government commitment to health, ability to pay, and efforts already achieved to nensure appropriate levels of staffing in all facilities. World Bank performance is rated as unsatisfactory, while Borrower performance is rated as marginally satisfactory. Most of the lessons drawn from this project have been identified in sector evaluations (for example, see report no. 21392 (OES)) and largely integrated in recent Bank guidelines for project preparation. This project illustrates that: Projects should be kept simple to avoid difficulties in implementation. Appropriate monitoring and evaluation indicators to measure project outcome, output, and progress need to be developed and their use in decisionmaking encouraged. Supervision intensity and adequacy of the Bank's team skill-mix have an important influence on project outcome. It is better to introduce new Bank procurement guidelines and standard bidding documents at the country level than on a project by project basis so that all parties are equally informed and given full opportunity to buy into these proposed improvements. The Bank should have given more consideration to its prior experience in this country.",,Malaysia - Health Development Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/608771468050090811/pdf/multi0page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/608771468050090811/text/multi0page.txt,/projects/documents/2001/12/1671242/malaysia-health-development-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/608771468050090811/Malaysia-Health-Development-Project,2001/12/1671242/malaysia-health-development-project,608771468050090811,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/608771468050090811/Malaysia-Health-Development-Project,D1671242,31,,,Health,Asia,,,,,,,,,,Project design; Monitoring & evaluation; Project supervision; Procurement guidelines; Bidding documents; Project delays; Land acquisition; Public consultation; Land ownership; Technical specifications; Mid-term reviews; Policy dialogues; Disbursements; Reporting; Disbursement schedules; Construction sites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lessons learned indicate that the choice of loan instrument allowed flexibility with a long-term institutional development project in the context of an evolving decentralization process. Trigger indicators to move from one phase to another should be carefully selected and evaluated, considering institutional capacity and technical needs. In this project, while the selection of ambitious trigger indicators is laudable, it required two extensions to fully achieve the indicators and delayed passage to the second phase. Health sector projects in the context of decentralization require a better integration of Bank financing mechanisms with country financing mechanisms. In the case of public health surveillance and disease control, the strengthening of sub-national (state) and local (municipal) public health structures is fundamental to a successful system. The use of convenios and subprojects governed by Bank rules was very dysfunctional. The VIGISUS I subprojects involved decentralized execution and the amount of support required for states and municipalities to carry out procurement and other processes was underestimated.

The Primary Health Care approach includes three integrated, interdependent components: health services, intersectoriality, and social participation in terms of empowering individuals, families and communities to take charge of their own health. Within this conceptual framework, Colombia has tackled the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic formally announcedby the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. This report examines the role of PHC in Colombia&#8250;s preparation for, response to, and recovery from the pandemic. The main features of the pandemic affecting the country are described first, followed by observations stemming from analysis of the regulatory component, the healthcare services delivered, and the role of public health communication and surveillance.

GHG is addressing the medical skills gap, and it is offering essential services including maternal, newborn, child health, infectious, and non-communicable diseases treatments in communities where Georgians live and work. As GHG expands the availability of quality primary care at outpatient polyclinics, it can help control costs and reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention. As countries are embracing UHC principles, all are struggling with affordability.

Tracking progress towards UHC requires measurement of both dimensions, and a way of trading them off. The authors measure service coverage (SC) by a weighted geometric average of four prevention and four treatment indicators, financial protection (FP) by the incidence of 'catastrophic' health expenditures (those exceeding ten percent of household consumption or income), and a country's UHC performance as a geometric average of the SC index and the complement of the incidence of catastrophic expenditures. They adjust SC for inequality, penalizing high-inequality countries. The authors obtain the bulk of our data from over 1,700 household surveys. A low incidence of catastrophic expenses sometimes reflects low SC (often in low-income countries) but sometimes occurs despite high SC (often in high-income countries). At a given level of SC, too, FP varies. UHC index scores are higher in higher-income countries, but there are variations within income groups. Adjusting the UHC index for inequality in SC makes little difference in some countries, but not all. Most countries have increased their UHC index, sometimes sharply, many by improving both UHC dimensions. Some have increased their UHC index despite reductions in FP by substantially increasing their SC. Some countries have seen their UHC index fall, mostly because FP has worsened with stagnant or declining SC. The SC and UHC index are significantly associated with GDP per capita and the share spent on health. Spending by social health insurance and government schemes is significantly associated with the SC index, FP and the UHC index, but spending by other schemes is not. It was concluded that the progress towards UHC can be tracked using an index that captures both SC and FP.",,A Comprehensive Assessment of Universal Health Coverage in One Hundred and Fifteen Countries and Territories : A Retrospective Observational Study,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/946091560345147029/pdf/A-Comprehensive-Assessment-of-Universal-Health-Coverage-in-One-Hundred-and-Fifteen-Countries-and-Territories-A-Retrospective-Observational-Study.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/946091560345147029/text/A-Comprehensive-Assessment-of-Universal-Health-Coverage-in-One-Hundred-and-Fifteen-Countries-and-Territories-A-Retrospective-Observational-Study.txt,/research/2019/04/31147552/comprehensive-assessment-universal-health-coverage-one-hundred-fifteen-countries-territories-retrospective-observational-study,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/946091560345147029/A-Comprehensive-Assessment-of-Universal-Health-Coverage-in-One-Hundred-and-Fifteen-Countries-and-Territories-A-Retrospective-Observational-Study,2019/04/31147552/comprehensive-assessment-universal-health-coverage-one-hundred-fifteen-countries-territories-retrospective-observational-study,946091560345147029,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/946091560345147029/A-Comprehensive-Assessment-of-Universal-Health-Coverage-in-One-Hundred-and-Fifteen-Countries-and-Territories-A-Retrospective-Observational-Study,D31147552,44,"Wagstaff, Adam","Neelsen,Sven",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pilot focuses on the vaccine market, where research, development and production of vaccines specific to the needs of the poorest developing countries are limited by the small number of manufacturers, high cost of product development and capacity scale-up, and demand uncertainty. The pilot Advance Market Commitment's (AMC's) principal goal is to accelerate the creation of a viable market for pneumococcal vaccines for developing countries, by providing up-front financing to cover capital costs associated with the development of additional vaccine production capacity to meet demand from developing countries. The pilot's focus is pneumococcal vaccines, for which the key technological issues have been resolved and there is substantial demand in poor developing countries. Pneumonial infections are the largest killer of children in Africa and worldwide and pneumococcal infections are the largest cause of pneumonia deaths. The specific design of the AMC pilot is intended to: a) spur development of vaccines needed in developing countries; b) foster and accelerate dedicated production capacity scale-up; c) provide a predictable and sustainable long-term price; and d) address the high demand risk and demand uncertainty faced by the vaccine industry.",,Pilot advance market commitment for vaccines against pneumococcal diseases,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/505471468333856058/pdf/480610BR0R200910disclosed0417120091.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/505471468333856058/text/480610BR0R200910disclosed0417120091.txt,/projects/documents/2009/03/10431416/pilot-advance-market-commitment-vaccines-against-pneumococcal-diseases,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/505471468333856058/Pilot-advance-market-commitment-for-vaccines-against-pneumococcal-diseases,2009/03/10431416/pilot-advance-market-commitment-vaccines-against-pneumococcal-diseases,505471468333856058,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/505471468333856058/Pilot-advance-market-commitment-for-vaccines-against-pneumococcal-diseases,D10431416,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The country seems to be at an early epidemic phase with low HIV prevalence, but there are a number of underlying vulnerability factors that could lead to the conditions for epidemic expansion, including drug trafficking, the post-conflict situation with displacement of populations, a fledgling health care system, and a low level of knowledge and awareness about HIV/AIDS. As in other parts of central and south Asia, the most important proximate determinants of the scale and distribution of an HIV epidemic in Afghanistan will be the size and characteristics of high risk networks involving injecting drug users (IDUs), female sex workers (FSWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) who are at high risk. Assessments from elsewhere in central Asia indicate an explosive growth in injecting drug use and commercial sex work throughout the region, concurrent epidemics of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and economic and political migration. As yet, little information is known about the size, distribution, and characteristics of IDU and sex worker sub-populations in Afghanistan. Therefore, the World Bank (WB) agreed with the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) to contract with the University of Manitoba (UM) to conduct an assessment of these three key, high risk populations in three cities of Afghanistan (Mazar-i-Sharif, Jalalabad, and Kabul).",South Asia human development sector series ; no. 23,Mapping and situation assessment of key populations at high risk of HIV in three cities of Afghanistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/300611468197940696/pdf/437330NWP0Box31gAfghanistanApril708.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/300611468197940696/text/437330NWP0Box31gAfghanistanApril708.txt,/research/2008/04/9452047/mapping-situation-assessment-key-populations-high-risk-hiv-three-cities-afghanistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/300611468197940696/Mapping-and-situation-assessment-of-key-populations-at-high-risk-of-HIV-in-three-cities-of-Afghanistan,2008/04/9452047/Mapping-and-situation-assessment-of-key-populations-at-high-risk-of-HIV-in-three-cities-of-Afghanistan,300611468197940696,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/300611468197940696/Mapping-and-situation-assessment-of-key-populations-at-high-risk-of-HIV-in-three-cities-of-Afghanistan,D9452047,32,"Claeson, Mariam",,,South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This impairs the ability of cities to support economic growth and meet basic needs. Faced by this challenge, the Nazim of the City District Government of Karachi (CDGK) suggested in mid-2004 that the Water and Sanitation Program - South Asia (WSP-SA) help to arrange a discussion about lessons for Karachi from Water and Sanitation (W&S) services reform in large cities and urban areas elsewhere in the world. In follow up discussions, it was agreed that although Karachi would be the entry point, the workshop should also include discussion of similar challenges elsewhere in Pakistan. Key W&S stakeholders from major cities in Pakistan, the central government and the provincial government of Sindh (where Karachi is located) attended a two-day workshop in Karachi on February 23-24, 2005. The WSP-SA facilitated participation by several resource persons, including practitioners from Manila, Johannesburg, Phnom Penh and from the national water utility in Uganda. The formal presentations and delegates' inputs all emphasized the institutional-rather than technical- nature of the challenges around water and sanitation in Pakistani cities. This message also came through in a number of keynote addresses. A key lesson learned from the workshop is that there is no single solution or model for water management that can be applied everywhere. However, international and Pakistani city experiences all highlight a number of factors crucial for effective reform in most contexts. These factors include the importance of reliable information; the need for performance benchmarks and monitoring; the issue of keeping policymaking, regulation, and provision separate and therefore ensuring a robust accountability framework; strong political leadership,; having a comprehensive plan; sticking to the principles, while being pragmatic in strategy; managing change processes; proving powerful incentives; and the need to have resources to sustain reform plans and initiatives.",Water and sanitation program working paper,Managing Karachi's water supply and sanitation services : lessons from a workshop,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/260251468087833520/pdf/344430PK0Karachi0water0supply.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/260251468087833520/text/344430PK0Karachi0water0supply.txt,/research/2005/08/6439603/managing-karachis-water-supply-sanitation-services-lessons-workshop,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/260251468087833520/Managing-Karachis-water-supply-and-sanitation-services-lessons-from-a-workshop,2005/08/6439603/managing-karachis-water-supply-sanitation-services-lessons-workshop,260251468087833520,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/260251468087833520/Managing-Karachis-water-supply-and-sanitation-services-lessons-from-a-workshop,D6439603,16,,,,South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Missions fielded by the Bank were balanced and had the necessary expertise to provide the level of guidance and supervision necessary for project implementation; however, Bank supervision probably should have been more intensive in the first several years of project implementation. The project was well conceived and represents the best technical solution for providing a reliable source of quality water for domestic and industrial use and for irrigating small holdings. The project's physical goals have been achieved, and the planned infrastructure aimed at removing the main constraint on agricultural and industrial development and improving health standards is in place. With proper operation and maintenance, the full potential benefits of this project will be realized. The lessons learned from the project can be summarized as follows: (a) The project was delayed partially because of delays in the appointment of consultants, leading to delays in the finalization of project design.

Yet as the contents of this volume make clear, the health services supported by governments, and by agencies like ours too often fail to reach these people who need them most. This is not acceptable. Nor need it be accepted. The studies presented here point to numerous strategies that can help health programs reach the poor much more effectively than at present. In doing so, they strongly reinforce the messages of the 2004 World Development Report and other recent publications about the importance and possibility of making services work better for poor people. Different views will be formed about which of the strategies are most promising for a particular setting-whether, for example, one would be best advised to follow Brazil's approach of seeking universal coverage for basic health services, Cambodia's strategy of contracting with non-governmental organizations, Nepal's use of participatory program development, or some other approach. The report provides a discussion on issues like these, in order to build upon the important basic findings presented herewith, i.e., that better performance is possible. In brief, better performance in reaching the poor is both needed and feasible. These are the two messages from this report that will be discussed further.",,"Reaching the poor with health, nutrition, and population services : what works, what doesn't, and why",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/244121468315279304/pdf/347160Reaching101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/244121468315279304/text/347160Reaching101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.txt,/research/2005/01/6485296/reaching-poor-health-nutrition-population-services-works-doesnt,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/244121468315279304/Reaching-the-poor-with-health-nutrition-and-population-services-what-works-what-doesnt-and-why,2005/01/6485296/Reaching-the-poor-with-health-nutrition-and-population-services-what-works-what-doesnt-and-why,244121468315279304,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/244121468315279304/Reaching-the-poor-with-health-nutrition-and-population-services-what-works-what-doesnt-and-why,D6485296,380,"Gwatkin, Davidson R.

The Bank and the Borrower both received moderately unsatisfactory performance ratings. The amounts allocated to the project components were revised in June 2013 as follows: a reallocation of funds from Category 1a (Insurance Premium Subsidies) to a new Category 6 (medical services) and a reallocation of funds for the implementation of the exit strategy and for management cost from Category 1a (Insurance Premium Subsidies) to Category 1b (Marketing Subsidies), Category 2 (HIF Project Management), Category 3 (Monitoring and Evaluation), and Category 4 (Audit). The project closing date was also extended by nine months. The following seven lessons were also learned from this project: (1) Integrating impact evaluation in the design of an innovative pilot project is critical for documenting lessons learned. If an impact evaluation had been carried out, it would have helped in understanding the counterfactual (i.e. what would have happened in the absence of the project) (2) Coordination with multi-levels of Government in the design and implementation of community-based health insurance scheme is key to ownership and financial sustainability. (3) In-depth target group analysis during project preparation is necessary to inform the project design, including establishing the co-premium, selecting the appropriate target group, and minimizing adverse selection, moral hazard and other insurance risks. (4) Reviewing the acceptability of premium rates and benefit packages for enrollment by low-income employees (and their family members) at design and during implementation is critical to increasing enrollment and renewal rates. (5) Rating service providers in the health insurance scheme network and monitoring progress against quality improvement plans, contributes to enhanced compliance with the service quality standards. (6) Engaging expensive private hospitals for community based health insurance scheme can lead to excess payments by the health care management organization or lead to providers prematurely dropping out of the scheme.

They offer this benefit in exchange for payment of a predetermined amount of money called premium. By pulling similar risks together insurance companies transform the unpredictability of the occurrence of an event to an individual into expected events affecting any one of the insured participants. Insurance companies do not care whom they pay to but only that they have to pay a claim. The theory that explains this transformation is based on the central limit theorem. This theorem basically states that a large enough number of similar risks behave in the fashion of a Gaussian distribution. A key assumption in the application of the theorem is that the risks need to be similar or behave in a homogeneous manner. Thus insurance companies can only create value by reducing the volatility of the claims if their portfolio consists of homogeneous risks, or at least if there is a sufficiently large number of similar risks and these are treated as one portfolio. In practice companies do accept risks that have different risk profile but the acceptance of those risks is done under different conditions, like charging an extra premium, applying exclusions or waiting periods to restore the necessary risk homogeneity in the portfolio. Underwriter's play the important role in insurance companies of selecting and accepting risks that behave similarly or assessing the necessary acceptance conditions to those risks that differ to maintain the homogeneity of the portfolio. As an example, the motor insurance premium varies according to the risk characteristics of the driver and the car. Thus a driver that according to past experience has twice the probability of having an accident will be requested to pay twice the standard premium. Driving under the influence of alcohol increases the probability of having an accident, hence underwriters will exclude the coverage if the accident happens under this condition. A person undergoing surgery will only be granted life coverage after a waiting period that according to the underwriter is necessary to classify the risk as a normal risk.",Primer series on insurance ; issue no. 8,The role of the underwriter in insurance,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/119821468330330328/pdf/625060NWP0The000Box0361486B0PUBLIC0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/119821468330330328/text/625060NWP0The000Box0361486B0PUBLIC0.txt,/research/2009/09/14356978/role-underwriter-insurance,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/119821468330330328/The-role-of-the-underwriter-in-insurance,2009/09/14356978/role-underwriter-insurance,119821468330330328,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/119821468330330328/The-role-of-the-underwriter-in-insurance,D14356978,30,"Macedo, Lionel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They consider a hypothetical vaccine costing ten dollars to produce, and offering sixty percent, seventy five percent, and ninety percent reductions in the risk of HIV for ten years. For each of the world's ten major geographic divisions, they sue published estimates of the risk of AIDS, the value of medical costs averted, and the value of potential productivity losses. Under the ""health sector"" algorithm - in which purchases are made to minimize the impact of AIDS/HIV on government health spending - 766 million courses of vaccine would be purchased. Under the ""societal"" algorithm - in which purchases are made to minimize the impact of AIDS/HIV on health spending and GDP - more than 3.7 billion courses of vaccine would be purchased. Under an ""equity"" model - allocating vaccines to everyone in the world at high risk, as if they had the financial resources of Western Europeans - vaccine would be offered to 4.7 billion people. For a Western European man, reducing the risk of AIDS/HIV would be a $789 concern; in Africa, the comparable risk would be a $48,577 crisis. The authors conclude that financing AIDS vaccines solely on the fixed budget of a ministry of health, means large vulnerable populations wouldn't receive the vaccine. Allocating the vaccine based on society's ability to pay would still exclude many poor infants who would probably be immunized if they were born in more developed regions. Policymakers concerned about equity in health care must redouble efforts to making the financing of development, and distribution of AIDS vaccines, a global, not a regional concern.","Policy, Research working paper ; no.

The construction of these bridges will impact on the surface water quality the impact will come from the oil that may leak into the river; the construction under water will cause silts to be suspended, the loss of abandoned construction waste or construction material, construction clay mortar and domestic wastewater near construction site. In operation period, the sewage sources are mainly locomotive depot, wastewater that contains oil discharged from production sections such as vehicle section and domestic wastewater discharged from each station. The main air pollution in construction phase will be from construction dust. After implementation of the project, the existing diesel engine traction locomotives will be replaced by electric traction locomotive. Domestic waste and train waste generated from each station and section will also increase. A new environment impact, electromagnetic pollution will occur. The local land resources will definitely be impacted due to the large amount of land acquisition and removal. Following are some of the mitigation measures: (i) the railway line will be carefully selected to avoid occupying the sensitive ecosystems; (ii) the earthworks will use the excavated earth as backfill where at all possible and minimize the occupation of farmland, cultivated land, and woodlands; (iii) vertical landscaping shall be carried out on the outer sides of the railway stations; (iv) the operation of high-level noise construction shall be 200 meters far from the residential areas, and the low-level noise equipment shall be adopted. Main construction activities shall be strictly controlled within the daytime. Temporary sound-insulation facilities shall be used to decrease the effect of mechanical noise. Construction vehicles shall be arranged to steer clear of the residential areas whenever possible. At the ZheGanLine same time, such vehicles are forbidden to go through the residential areas at night; and (v) watering shall be carried out for temporary roads that have not been laid that are built for the various railway construction site. It shall be done two times per day (one time in morning and another in afternoon) to ease the pollution of dust emissions. The number of watering shall be augmented in dry or blustery contractors Zheanline weather. Covering canvas shall be used for the transportation of cement, sand, lime, and so on.

IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world’s 75 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa. Resources from IDA bring positive change to the 1.5 billion people who live in IDA countries. Since 1960, IDA has supported development work in 113 countries. Annual commitments have averaged about $18 billion over the last three years, with about 54 percent going to Africa. The world looks to IDA to address big problems—from relief for countries hit by Ebola, to reconstruction in Afghanistan, to countries dealing with growing climate-related disasters. No other international institution has the mandate, cross-sector knowledge, and resources to respond to complex global challenges with an exclusive focus on the world’s poorest countries. IDA is innovative. We are helping countries leapfrog traditional energy sources by harnessing the sun to light homes and power businesses, and to deal with the effects of a changing environment while building climate-smart resilience for the long term. We are working to find new ways to integrate women and other vulnerable citizens into society as equals. And we are there for the long haul, helping put countries on a path to stability and growth after conflict and other disasters. With IDA’s help, hundreds of millions of people have escaped poverty—through the creation of jobs, access to clean water, schools, roads, nutrition, electricity, and more. From 2011 to 2017, IDA funding helped immunize a quarter of a billion children, provide access to better water sources for 72 million, and helped 602 million people receive health services. IDA is replenished every three years with contributions from developed and developing country donors, as well as from two other agencies of the World Bank Group: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. And IDA works. With help from IDA, 35 countries have “graduated.” Their economic development means they are no longer reliant on IDA support, and many have gone on to become IDA donors. Helping countries build the institutions and capacities to help themselves and putting them on a path to fund their own development is a priority for IDA. Learn more about what IDA has achieved in the results highlighted on the following pages, and be sure to see our other “ABCs” (achievements by country) of IDA on Africa, gender, conflict and fragility, climate change, and institutional strengthening.",,THE ABCs of IDA : key achievements by country,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/386451533563132430/pdf/129221-WP-ENGLISH-abcs-ida-by-country-2017-PUBLIC.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/386451533563132430/text/129221-WP-ENGLISH-abcs-ida-by-country-2017-PUBLIC.txt,/research/2017/10/30329271/abcs-ida-key-achievements-country,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/386451533563132430/THE-ABCs-of-IDA-key-achievements-by-country,2017/10/30329271/abcs-ida-key-achievements-country,386451533563132430,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/386451533563132430/THE-ABCs-of-IDA-key-achievements-by-country,D30329271,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The process for the Know Your Epidemic (KYE) was an in-depth review of available epidemiological data from Lesotho and the sub-region, and application of the UNAIDS incidence estimation model. The aim was to determine the epidemiology of new (incident) infections. For the Know Your Response (KYR) part, data were collected on the policy context for prevention and on implemented prevention activities and programs. Prevention-specific data from the National AIDS Spending Assessment (NASA) of 2008 and previous two years were reviewed. In a final step, the KYE and KYR evidence was linked to produce an epidemic, response and policy synthesis with recommendations to improve HIV prevention in Lesotho through aligning prevention activities with the evidence on the sources of new infections. The study examined the hypothesis that multiple longer-term partnerships between single young people as well as between married or cohabiting adults are the major driver of HIV transmission, happening in a context of relaxed social norms regarding multiple partners and low risk perception. The findings confirmed this hypothesis -- sexual concurrency is exceptionally high in Lesotho; multiple sexual relationships before and during marriage, together with low levels of full male circumcision are major risk factors in Lesotho's hyper endemic HIV situation.",,Lesotho - HIV prevention response and modes of transmission analysis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/802971468331880614/pdf/483570SR0P1113101same0box101PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/802971468331880614/text/483570SR0P1113101same0box101PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2009/03/10592758/lesotho-hiv-prevention-response-modes-transmission-analysis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/802971468331880614/Lesotho-HIV-prevention-response-and-modes-of-transmission-analysis,2009/03/10592758/lesotho-hiv-prevention-response-modes-transmission-analysis,802971468331880614,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/802971468331880614/Lesotho-HIV-prevention-response-and-modes-of-transmission-analysis,D10592758,121,,,Health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data are intended to serve as a source of basic information for use in preparing analyses and developing initiatives to benefit poor people. At the volume's core are the overview tables in the following section. Each overview table provides figures dealing with inequalities across economically-defined quintiles of the population for a single hnp indicator for all of the fifty-six countries covered. The 120 indicators presented are in four categories: health status (such as infant and child mortality, child nutritional level, and fertility); use of basic health services (immunization, treatment of common childhood illnesses, antenatal care, and assisted delivery); health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking and alcohol use and sexual practices); and other health-status determinants (like education). The purpose of this opening chapter is to explain how data appearing in the overview tables and in the individual country reports came into being, and how they can be used to help shape policies and programs. To this end, it deals with four topics. The first is the rationale for the tables' focus on the economic dimension of health inequalities. The second is the source of the data and the methods used to produce the tables. Third shows illustrations of how the information presented in the tables can be used to facilitate health policy and program development. The fourth shows how the techniques used in producing the information can be used to monitor how well or poor programs or policies have reached the poor.",Country reports on HNP and poverty,"Socio-economic differences in health, nutrition, and population within developing countries : an overview",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/962091468332070548/pdf/483610WP0Socio10Box338901B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/962091468332070548/text/483610WP0Socio10Box338901B01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2007/09/10531470/socio-economic-differences-health-nutrition-population-within-developing-countries-overview,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/962091468332070548/Socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population-within-developing-countries-an-overview,2007/09/10531470/socio-economic-differences-health-nutrition-population-within-developing-countries-overview,962091468332070548,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/962091468332070548/Socio-economic-differences-in-health-nutrition-and-population-within-developing-countries-an-overview,D10531470,301,"Amouzou,Agbessi","Gwatkin,Davidson R",,,,"Johnson,Kiersten Blair","Rutstein,Shea","Suliman,Eldaw Abdalla","Wagstaff,Robert Adam Stephen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several lessons were drawn from the project's experience, which featured how to align research with national priorities, and the needs of indigenous people and the poor. Lessons however, highlight that the initial proposal should have contained a plan for the transition to regular activities, given that support for Centers and Nuclei should only be provided based on a clear strategy of how activities will be continued after the end of the grant period. Expecting a follow-up on the project, the Institute of Fluid Mechanics used grants to finance recurrent expenditures on a non-declining basis. As a consequence, the Center faces the challenge of sustaining the investment in the training of highly-skilled researchers. In addition, extra efforts are needed for human resource formation in countries with no critical mass, but faced with university graduates willing to undergo a career in sciences, but where most researchers do not have adequate qualifications. The project however showed that provision of research staff can be attained through adequate training programs. Nonetheless, further lessons outline that investigator autonomy is key to research success, while supporting network and dissemination activities should not be underestimated.",,Venezuela - Millennium Science Initiative Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/666381468130818368/pdf/317310rev.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/666381468130818368/text/317310rev.txt,/projects/documents/2005/06/6027583/venezuela-millennium-science-initiative-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/666381468130818368/Venezuela-Millennium-Science-Initiative-Project,2005/06/6027583/Venezuela-Millennium-Science-Initiative-Project,666381468130818368,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/666381468130818368/Venezuela-Millennium-Science-Initiative-Project,D6027583,31,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Tertiary Education",South America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The papers in this series aim to provide a vehicle for publishing preliminary and unpolished results on HNP topics to encourage discussion and debate. Pakistan has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world, and over 50 percent of deaths in post-neonatal children are attributable to pneumonia, diarrhea, or meningitis diseases that can be prevented through vaccination. The purpose of the study is to compare the cost-effectiveness and financial implications of introducing pneumococcal (PCV-10), rotavirus (Rota-Teq), and Homophiles influenza type B (Hib) vaccines in Pakistan. The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using the Tri-Vac model, which is a static model that estimates the burden of disease and the costs of treatment and for the immunization program of children up to five years old in ten annual birth cohorts (2010 to 2019). Sensitivity analyses were conducted testing key assumptions related to disease burden, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine cost. The analysis of financial implications included a projection of cold chain needs and costs associated with the introduction of each new vaccine, as well as the financial outlays required by the government. Sensitivity testing was also conducted on major assumptions. All three vaccines were found to be cost-effective, with Hib vaccine the most cost-effective option at $22 per disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY). The cost-effectiveness figures for PCV and rotavirus vaccines were $225/DALY and $201/DALY, respectively. Sensitivity testing did not significantly alter the results. The combined financial requirement for the three new vaccines would peak in 2017 if GAVI assistance reduced to five rather than eight years ($213m). This cost would account for 40 percent of national immunization expenditures, and 15 percent of government health expenditures. Required cold chain investments would be small relative to the expenditure on vaccines, and represents a good return on investment. While the investment would be worthwhile from an economic perspective, introducing all three vaccines in Pakistan will present financial challenges unless overall health spending increases. Careful consideration needs to be given to long-term financing after GAVI support ends.","Health, Nutrition and Population (HNP) discussion paper",Cost-effectiveness and financial consequences of new vaccine introduction in Pakistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/632981468287136463/pdf/658300WP0Vacci00box365730B00PUBLIC0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/632981468287136463/text/658300WP0Vacci00box365730B00PUBLIC0.txt,/research/2011/10/15516148/cost-effectiveness-financial-consequences-new-vaccine-introduction-pakistan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/632981468287136463/Cost-effectiveness-and-financial-consequences-of-new-vaccine-introduction-in-Pakistan,2011/10/15516148/cost-effectiveness-financial-consequences-new-vaccine-introduction-pakistan,632981468287136463,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/632981468287136463/Cost-effectiveness-and-financial-consequences-of-new-vaccine-introduction-in-Pakistan,D15516148,44,"Brenzel, Logan","Sanderson, Colin",,South Asia,,"Galayda, Victor","Masud, Tayyeb","Haq, Inaaml ul",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CPS focuses on three pillars: (i) improving economic competitiveness; (ii) minimizing social and environmental risks, building human capital, and promoting social inclusion; and (iii) improving public sector governance. The CPS envisages annual commitments of approximately USD 45-50 million. The International Development Association (IDA-15) lending envelope, along with an additional USD 20 million, and USD 11.2 million from the IDA Crisis Response Window, have been fully utilized. IFC has actively increased its activities in the last three years with a total of USD 79 million in investments and envisages annual commitments of USD 30-40 million. Modifications proposed to the CPS respond to the changed environment. The pillars of the strategy remain valid for the post-crisis period. The Bank will continue to be selective given its limited resources and will remain flexible to adjust to changing economic and political realities. Resources will be put into core areas with solid track records, strong government ownership and commitment to reform, and opportunities for strategic partnerships. Where other partners are in the lead, the Bank may exit or scale down. Given the opportunity provided by a reform-minded Government, we propose that the CPS period be extended to the end of FY13 to support key reforms and consolidate and focus the Bank's program, with a new CPS starting in FY14.",,Moldova - Country partnership strategy progress report for the period FY09-FY13 : Raport de Progres al Strategiei de Parteneriat cu Tara Pentru Moldova : Perioada AF09-AF13,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/365861468062102346/pdf/619230ROMANIAN0IC00MOLDOVA0CPSPR0RO.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/365861468062102346/text/619230ROMANIAN0IC00MOLDOVA0CPSPR0RO.txt,/projects/documents/2011/04/15957241/moldova-country-partnership-strategy-progress-report-period-fy09-fy13-raport-de-progres-al-strategiei-de-parteneriat-cu-tara-pentru-moldova-perioada-af09-af13,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/365861468062102346/Raport-de-Progres-al-Strategiei-de-Parteneriat-cu-Tara-Pentru-Moldova-Perioada-AF09-AF13,2011/04/15957241/moldova-country-partnership-strategy-progress-report-period-fy09-fy13-raport-de-progres-al-strategiei-de-parteneriat-cu-tara-pentru-moldova-perioada-af09-af13,365861468062102346,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/365861468062102346/Raport-de-Progres-al-Strategiei-de-Parteneriat-cu-Tara-Pentru-Moldova-Perioada-AF09-AF13,D15957241,43,,,,Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the heart of this debate is the ""precautionary principle,"" which holds that precautions should be taken against health, safety, and environmental risks even when science has not established direct cause-and-effect relationships--as with, for example, the EUropean ban on hormone-treated beef. The authors quantify the impact on food exports from African countries of new EUropean Union standards for aflatoxins, structurally related toxic compounds that contaminate certain foods and lead to the production of acute liver carcinogens in the human body. The authors estimate the impact of changes in differing levels of such protection based on the EU standards (and suggested by international standards) for 15 EUropean countries and 9 African countries between 1989 and 1998. The results suggest that implementation of the EU's new aflatoxin standards will significantly hurt African exports to EUrope of nuts, cereals, and dried fruits, which are highly sensitive to the aflatoxin standards. The EU standards would reduce health risks by only about 1.4 deaths per billion a year but would cut African exports by 64 percent, or $670 million, compared with their level under international standards.","Policy, Research working paper,no.

The environmental impact assessment covers both countries. Resettlement plans will be implemented for displacement of households from farm lands. The impacts on biological resources include removal of vegetative cover and shade canopy increasing soil surface temperature, decreasing moisture content, killing soil organisms and increasing potential for erosion in the oil field development and along the pipeline. A buffer zone will be set up to minimize the impacts. The project will also incorporate environmental measures to avoid potential disturbance to aquatic resources from oil spills. Induced access to undisturbed wooded savanna and riverine vegetation during construction and operation may lead to reduction of natural resources. This will be mitigated by controlling unauthorized use of pipeline route during construction. Increased peak flows and sediment loads of small tributaries of drainage will be corrected by draining surface runoff to more than one tributary. Disturbances to existing local supply wells caused by continuous withdrawal of project water supplies will be reduced by staggering project water supply wells. Reduced water quality caused from wastewater discharge will be corrected by treating sanitary wastewater in compliance with the World Bank effluent guidelines.","World Development Sources, WDS 1998-4","Chad, Cameroon - Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 4)",,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/396501468742899757/text/multi0page.txt,/projects/documents/1998/06/442032/chad-cameroon-petroleum-development-pipeline-project-environmental-assessment-vol-4,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/396501468742899757/Chad-Cameroon-Petroleum-Development-and-Pipeline-Project-environmental-assessment,1998/06/442032/chad-cameroon-petroleum-development-pipeline-project-environmental-assessment-vol-4-32,396501468742899757,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/396501468742899757/Chad-Cameroon-Petroleum-Development-and-Pipeline-Project-environmental-assessment,D442032,null,ESSO Exploration and Production Chad Inc.,Dames,"Roads and highways,Telecommunications,Oil and Gas,Ports/Waterways,Railways",Sahel,,,,,,,,,,Drainage; Erosion control; Oil fields; Oil spillages; Petroleum exports; Pipelines; Resettlement; Sewerage; Soils; Vegetation; Water quality; Wells,Central Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapidly increasing urbanization and, along with that, rising settlement densities in low-income urban and peri-urban areas highlight the need for sanitation technologies and management systems that are robust and affordable, and which lessen the pollution load on local water sources. In many developing countries, centralized sewerage and wastewater treatment systems cover only a portion of larger urban areas, and are often not yet planned for smaller towns and densely populated, low-income areas of cities. On-site sanitation is often inappropriate in the denser settlements and slum areas, thus requiring intermediate and complementary solutions. Decentralized wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS) connected to simplified sewer systems or communal sanitation centers have the potential to close the gap between on-site and centralized systems. Community-managed DEWATS offer the possibility of swift sanitation improvements in high priority neighborhoods that communities can manage themselves, where local government does not yet provide a full sanitation service. This review explores Indonesia's experience in implementing community-managed DEWATS on a growing scale, and more specifically, whether community-managed DEWATS are a viable urban sanitation option for serving poor households in dense settlements.",Water and sanitation program technical paper,Review of community-managed decentralized wastewater treatment systems in Indonesia,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/181941468260140100/pdf/851920WSP00Box0esia0Technical0Paper.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/181941468260140100/text/851920WSP00Box0esia0Technical0Paper.txt,/research/2013/06/19123168/review-community-managed-decentralized-wastewater-treatment-systems-indonesia,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/181941468260140100/Review-of-community-managed-decentralized-wastewater-treatment-systems-in-Indonesia,2013/06/19123168/review-community-managed-decentralized-wastewater-treatment-systems-indonesia,181941468260140100,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/181941468260140100/Review-of-community-managed-decentralized-wastewater-treatment-systems-in-Indonesia,D19123168,32,"Blackett,Isabel C.","Eales,Kathy",,Asia,,"Febriani,Evi","Siregar,Reini Farida",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The construction of these bridges will impact on the surface water quality the impact will come from the oil that may leak into the river; the construction under water will cause silts to be suspended, the loss of abandoned construction waste or construction material, construction clay mortar and domestic wastewater near construction site. In operation period, the sewage sources are mainly locomotive depot, wastewater that contains oil discharged from production sections such as vehicle section and domestic wastewater discharged from each station. The main air pollution in construction phase will be from construction dust. After implementation of the project, the existing diesel engine traction locomotives will be replaced by electric traction locomotive. Domestic waste and train waste generated from each station and section will also increase. A new environment impact, electromagnetic pollution will occur. The local land resources will definitely be impacted due to the large amount of land acquisition and removal. Following are some of the mitigation measures: (i) the railway line will be carefully selected to avoid occupying the sensitive ecosystems; (ii) the earthworks will use the excavated earth as backfill where at all possible and minimize the occupation of farmland, cultivated land, and woodlands; (iii) vertical landscaping shall be carried out on the outer sides of the railway stations; (iv) the operation of high-level noise construction shall be 200 meters far from the residential areas, and the low-level noise equipment shall be adopted. Main construction activities shall be strictly controlled within the daytime. Temporary sound-insulation facilities shall be used to decrease the effect of mechanical noise. Construction vehicles shall be arranged to steer clear of the residential areas whenever possible. At the ZheGanLine same time, such vehicles are forbidden to go through the residential areas at night; and (v) watering shall be carried out for temporary roads that have not been laid that are built for the various railway construction site. It shall be done two times per day (one time in morning and another in afternoon) to ease the pollution of dust emissions. The number of watering shall be augmented in dry or blustery contractors Zheanline weather. Covering canvas shall be used for the transportation of cement, sand, lime, and so on.

How food safety is addressed in the world trade system, is critical for developing countries that continue to rely on agricultural exports. In a fragmented system of conflicting national food safety standards, and no globally accepted standards, export prospects for the least developed countries, can be severely limited. The authors examine the impact that adopting international food safety standards, and harmonizing standards would have on global food trade patterns. They estimate the effect of aflatoxin standards in fifteen importing countries (including four developing countries) on exports from thirty one countries (twenty one of them developing). Aflatoxin is a natural substance that can contaminate certain nuts, and grains when storage, and drying facilities are inadequate. The analysis shows that adopting a worldwide standard for aflatoxin B1 (potentially the most toxic of aflatoxins) based on current international guidelines, would increase nut, and cereal trade among the countries studied, by $ 6.1 billion, compared with 1998 levels. This harmonization of standards would increase world exports by $ 38.8 billion.","Policy, Research working paper ; no.

Some lessons learned included: ensuring commitment and maintaining policy dialogue with key ministries beyond the health ministry, e.g. Ministry of Finance (MOF) and ministries responsible for decentralization and civil service reform is very important for achieving improvements in health. It necessitates a very good partnership and a sensitive approach to fully understand the complexities of government commitment, including ensuring the commitment and incentives for the lower levels of government. Understanding the political economy, not least for complex countries like Bangladesh, is important. More flexibility from Development Partners (DPs) to adapt to changing national priorities will help resolve any disagreements that may arise while implementing the project. Performance based funding is challenging, both in terms of identifying appropriate indicators and targets, and also in terms of understanding whether the incentives it provides can be expected to yield the desired results. The overall incentive structure of the system, and not least the specific incentives of the unit responsible for achieving the target, need to be thoroughly analyzed. Establishing new entities within a government system, with rules and regulations different from those of government, is very difficult. Such initiatives should not only be discussed and agreed upon at the highest level of the Government but also with the actual implementers to ensure buy-in from all levels of the Government and that proposed reforms are feasible. For large sector programs like HNPSP, which rely on Government's Financial Management (FM) system, specific systems strengthening component will have mitigated some of the issues emanating from weak fiduciary capacity.",,"Bangladesh - Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector Program Project",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/498461468207269738/pdf/ICR3170P0748410C0disclosed070250120.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/498461468207269738/text/ICR3170P0748410C0disclosed070250120.txt,/projects/documents/2012/06/16546247/bangladesh-health-nutrition-population-sector-program-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/498461468207269738/Bangladesh-Health-Nutrition-and-Population-Sector-Program-Project,2012/06/16546247/bangladesh-health-nutrition-population-sector-program-project,498461468207269738,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/498461468207269738/Bangladesh-Health-Nutrition-and-Population-Sector-Program-Project,D16546247,70,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Other social services,Health,Other Public Administration,Other Education",South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This reference book was an attempt to systematically assess the cost-effectiveness (value for money) of interventions that would address the major sources of disease burden in low- and middle-income countries. DCP2, published in 2006, updated and extended DCP1 in several aspects, including explicit consideration of the implications for health systems of expanded intervention coverage. The third edition of DCP is being completed and will consist of nine volumes. DCP3 differs importantly from DCP1 and DCP2 by extending and consolidating the concepts of platforms and packages and by offering explicit consideration of the financial risk protection objective of health systems. The task in all the volumes has been to combine the available science about interventions implemented in very specific locales and under very specific conditions with informed judgment to reach reasonable conclusions about the impact of intervention mixes in diverse environments. DCP3's broad aim is to delineate essential intervention packages, such as the essential surgery package in this volume, and their related delivery platforms. This information will assist decision makers in allocating often tightly constrained budgets so that health system objectives are maximally achieved. DCP3's nine volumes are being published in 2015 and 2016 in an environment in which serious discussion continues about quantifying the sustainable development goal (SDG) for health (United Nations 2015). DCP3's analyses are well-placed to assist in choosing the means to attain the health SDG and assessing the related costs. Only when these volumes, and the analytic efforts on which they are based, are completed will we be able to explore SDG-related and other broad policy conclusions and generalizations. The final DCP3 volume will report those conclusions. Each individual volume will provide valuable specific policy analyses on the full range of interventions, packages, and policies relevant to its health topic.",Disease Control Priorities,"Disease control priorities, third edition : Essential surgery",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/655391468130824512/pdf/953590PUB0978100Box385362B00PUBLIC0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/655391468130824512/text/953590PUB0978100Box385362B00PUBLIC0.txt,/research/2015/03/24220983/disease-control-priorities-third-edition-essential-surgery,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/655391468130824512/Essential-surgery,2015/03/24220983/disease-control-priorities-third-edition-essential-surgery,655391468130824512,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/655391468130824512/Essential-surgery,D24220983,445,"Debas, Haile T.

Any chemical fertilizer application should be based on soil testing; (v) storage of grains andproducts like turmeric, redgram etc. needs drying to attain prescribed moisturelevel to avoid pest and disease infestation which may call for chemical use for management; (vi) storage facility should be wellventilated and free of moisture seepage. Care must be taken to ensure this during construction or renting of such facilities; (vii) use energy efficient equipmentfor processing (such as steam boilers in turmeric, steam roaster in cashew or aquapulper in coffee); (viii) organic produce may get contaminated when transported along with other non food commodities like fertilizers, pesticides etc.; (ix) lack of proper facilities toworkers may result in health issues; (x) increase the participation of women, especially those from the poor families; strengthen women in decision making;",,India - Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project : environmental assessment : Environmental and social management framework - Volume II,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/785551497260569912/pdf/SFG3427-EA-P157702-Box402914B-PUBLIC-Disclosed-6-12-17.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/785551497260569912/text/SFG3427-EA-P157702-Box402914B-PUBLIC-Disclosed-6-12-17.txt,/projects/documents/2017/06/27571684/india-tamil-nadu-rural-transformation-project-environmental-assessment-environmental-social-management-framework-volume-ii,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/785551497260569912/Environmental-and-social-management-framework-Volume-II,2017/06/27571684/india-tamil-nadu-rural-transformation-project-environmental-assessment-environmental-social-management-framework-volume-ii,785551497260569912,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/785551497260569912/Environmental-and-social-management-framework-Volume-II,D27571684,149,"Alex,Geeta",,"Other Non-bank Financial Institutions,Other industry,Agricultural markets, commercialization and agri-business,Other Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry,Animal production",Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Government has already taken important steps in formulating policy towards sector reform. Among them are the decentralization of responsibility for providing services to local governments and introducing a community-based approach in rural areas. Also, adopting the principle of full cost recovery is an important step to put the sector on a financially viable footing. Likewise institutional strengthening and capacity building have been recognized as key elements for reviving the sector. All of these measures support the implementation of the six point program suggested in this Note.",,Kyrgyz Republic - Water supply and wastewater sector note,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/173951468776989803/text/multi-page.txt,/research/1999/06/440939/kyrgyz-republic-water-supply-wastewater-sector-note,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/173951468776989803/Kyrgyz-Republic-Water-supply-and-wastewater-sector-note,1999/06/440939/kyrgyz-republic-water-supply-wastewater-sector-note,173951468776989803,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/173951468776989803/Kyrgyz-Republic-Water-supply-and-wastewater-sector-note,D440939,null,,,"Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management",Central Asia,,,,,,,,,,Water supply systems; Sanitation services; Cost recovery; Capacity building; Institution building; Community-based method; Decentralization; Reform policy; Service delivery; Best practices; Service delivery; Water consumption; Service coverage; Service quality; Wastewater treatment plants; Tariff structures; Cost-effectiveness; Pumping stations; Piped distribution of water; Facilties refurbishment; Drinking water treatment; Systems design & development; Private sector participation; Human resources development,Asia,South Eastern Europe and Balkans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lessons learned indicate that the project included well-justified components of technical assistance for the Institutional Development activities under the project, including training and consultancy studies for management strengthening, and the development of tariff policy. However, the project demonstrated that the benefits of such components will remain marginal unless there is total commitment on the part of Government for follow up action. The failure of the vodokanal to raise tariffs during the project period is explained by the role of the national Anti-Monopoly Committee (AMC) and its application of existing laws. The Atyrau vodokanal and the oblast were unfamiliar with the procedures and requirements of international financing institutions and in particular of the World Bank.",,Kazakhstan - Atyrau Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/858291468753307216/text/29705.txt,/projects/documents/2005/03/5680795/kazakhstan-atyrau-pilot-water-supply-sanitation-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/858291468753307216/Kazakhstan-Atyrau-Pilot-Water-Supply-and-Sanitation-Project,2005/03/5680795/kazakhstan-atyrau-pilot-water-supply-sanitation-project,858291468753307216,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/858291468753307216/Kazakhstan-Atyrau-Pilot-Water-Supply-and-Sanitation-Project,D5680795,null,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Sewerage,Water Supply,Sub-National Government",Asia,,,,,,,,,,,Central Asia,Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis in this paper shows that since 2000, disparity in selected health outcomes has been declining across provinces, largely due to earmarked central government allocations. By contrast, public expenditure on health is increasingly regressive (positively correlated with local income per capita) across provinces, and across prefectures and lower levels within provinces. The increasing inequity in public expenditure at sub-national levels indicates that incentives, responsibilities, and resources at sub-national levels are not well aligned with China's national priorities. To address the weaknesses in equity and efficiency that characterize China's health system and health outcomes, China's health system reform may require complementary reforms to improve governance for public service delivery across sectors.",Policy Research working paper ; no.

With twenty commissioned background studies, more than thirty case studies, visits to twenty one provinces in China, the report proposes practical, concrete steps toward a value-based integrated service model of healthcare financing and delivery, including: 1) Creating a new model of people-centered quality integrated health care that strengthens primary care as the core of the health system; 2) Continuously improve health care quality, establish an effective coordination mechanism, and actively engage all stakeholders and professional bodies to oversee improvements in quality and performance; 3) Empowering patients with knowledge and understanding of health services, so that there is more trust in the system and patients are actively engaged in their healthcare decisions; 4) Reforming public hospitals, so that they focus on complicated cases and delegate routine care to primary-care providers; 5) Changing incentives for providers, so they are rewarded for good patient health outcomes instead of the number of medical procedures used or drugs sold; 6) Boosting the status of the health workforce, especially primary-care providers, so they are better paid and supported to ensure a competent health workforce aligned with the new delivery system; 7) Allowing qualified private health providers to deliver cost-effective services and compete on a level playing field with the public sector, with the right regulatory oversight; and 8) Prioritizing public investments according to the burden of disease, where people live, and the kind of care people need on a daily basis.",,深化中国医药卫生体制改革 : 建设基于价值的优质服务提供体系,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/295711578038265140/pdf/Building-High-Quality-and-Value-Based-Service-Delivery.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/295711578038265140/text/Building-High-Quality-and-Value-Based-Service-Delivery.txt,/research/2019/07/31680798/healthy-china-deepening-health-reform-china-building-high-quality-value-based-service-delivery,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/295711578038265140/Building-High-Quality-and-Value-Based-Service-Delivery,2019/07/31680798/,295711578038265140,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/295711578038265140/Building-High-Quality-and-Value-Based-Service-Delivery,D31680798,361,,,,East Asia and Pacific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-7-5095-9180-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improving health care waste management practices, as recommended herewith, remains a difficult exercise in the absence of an integrated solid waste management system for the country.

The environmental impact assessment covers both countries. Resettlement plans will be implemented for displacement of households from farm lands. The impacts on biological resources include removal of vegetative cover and shade canopy increasing soil surface temperature, decreasing moisture content, killing soil organisms and increasing potential for erosion in the oil field development and along the pipeline. A buffer zone will be set up to minimize the impacts. The project will also incorporate environmental measures to avoid potential disturbance to aquatic resources from oil spills. Induced access to undisturbed wooded savanna and riverine vegetation during construction and operation may lead to reduction of natural resources. This will be mitigated by controlling unauthorized use of pipeline route during construction. Increased peak flows and sediment loads of small tributaries of drainage will be corrected by draining surface runoff to more than one tributary.

Moreover, the component will also have house demolition of some minorities; 2) the component construction will also produce noise and security problems to the nearby area and cause inconvenience to their outing and agricultural production; 3) after the component completion, the minorities need to pay small sum for wastewater treatment, which will add small burden to family expenses; and 4) river improvement component will also demolish houses riverain areas. Mitigation measures include: 1) the resettlement plan has been compiled and the measures have taken to avoid various social risks; 2) the project design has taken into account the sites for water pumping hence to avoid the impacts on farmland irrigation system of the minorities; and 3) house demolition will be compensated according to the compensation policies.",,China - Nanning Urban Environment Project : indigenous peoples plan : Social assessment report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/841251468218390908/pdf/IPP353.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/841251468218390908/text/IPP353.txt,/projects/documents/2009/01/11691886/china-nanning-urban-environment-project-indigenous-peoples-plan-social-assessment-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/841251468218390908/Social-assessment-report,2009/01/11691886/china-nanning-urban-environment-project-indigenous-peoples-plan-social-assessment-report,841251468218390908,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/841251468218390908/Social-assessment-report,D11691886,124,,,"Sanitation,Waste Management,Sewerage",East Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite expected overwhelming, positive environmental impacts, the EA identified both major, and secondary environmental issues, proposing mitigation measures as follows. The major issues are: 1) incidence of malaria surrounding water, and sanitation works - the health sector's national malaria program will be supplemented primarily through vector control strategies, targeted at controlling mosquito breeding areas, while, Insecticide Treated Bed-nets (ITB) will also be provided; 2) disposal of dried sewage sludge - the development of a wastewater treatment, and sludge reuse policy will address the long-term solutions needed, following the rehabilitation of lagoons, and water supply systems; and, 3) handling of chemicals during the process of the water system rehabilitation - precautionary clauses will include contractor's responsibility for training workers on chemical handling, and on provision of adequate safety gear, and, a contingency plan will specify measures for spill prevention, and hazardous chemical control. Other measures include soil contamination testing; fencing the surrounding areas to safeguard traffic; appropriate wastewater disposal at selected sites during construction; and, installation of screens, and barriers to abate noise, and air pollution.",,"Yemen - Municipal Water Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 12) : Environmental impact assessment, environmental management plan, and environmental monitoring plan for IBB City Water and Sanitation Project",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/603671468170074260/pdf/E4940V120P0576020Box353756B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/603671468170074260/text/E4940V120P0576020Box353756B01PUBLIC1.txt,/projects/documents/2006/12/12882411/yemen-municipal-water-project-environmental-assessment-vol-12-environmental-impact-assessment-environmental-management-plan-environmental-monitoring-plan-ibb-city-water-sanitation-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/603671468170074260/Environmental-impact-assessment-environmental-management-plan-and-environmental-monitoring-plan-for-IBB-City-Water-and-Sanitation-Project,2006/12/12882411/yemen-municipal-water-project-environmental-assessment-vol-12-12-environmental-impact-assessment-environmental-management-plan-environmental-monitoring-plan-ibb-city-water-sanitation-project,603671468170074260,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/603671468170074260/Environmental-impact-assessment-environmental-management-plan-and-environmental-monitoring-plan-for-IBB-City-Water-and-Sanitation-Project,D12882411,367,Dorsch Consult / Gitec Consult,,"Sub-National Government,Other industry,Sewerage,Water Supply",,,,,,,,,,,Environmental assessment; Water supply systems; Wastewater collection; Malaria prevention; Vector control; Mosquito control; Insecticides; Sewage sludge; Wastewater treatment; Policy formation; Sludge treatment; Hazardous substances; Chemical pollution; Precautionary principle; Contracting; Training of employees; Chemical spills; Contingency plans; Soil contamination; Traffic safety; Waste disposal; Noise abatement; Air pollution control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This requires prompt and frequent collection; (vi) storage of waste may then be moved to a temporary on-site storage location; (vii) all waste bags should in-place and intact at the end of transportation; (viii) waste bags should be placed in containers (e.g. cardboard boxes or wheeled, rigid, lidded plastic or galvanized bins), before being placed directly into the transportation vehicle; (ix) demonstrate that health care waste management is being implemented according to plan and existing regulatory procedures",,Nigeria - Basic Health Care Provision Fund Project : environmental assessment : Health care waste management plan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/718291525782654010/pdf/HCWMP-Draft-Report16-3-18-Version-1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/718291525782654010/text/HCWMP-Draft-Report16-3-18-Version-1.txt,/projects/documents/2018/03/29870060/nigeria-basic-health-care-provision-fund-project-environmental-assessment-health-care-waste-management-plan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/718291525782654010/Health-care-waste-management-plan,2018/03/29870060/nigeria-basic-health-care-provision-fund-project-environmental-assessment-health-care-waste-management-plan,718291525782654010,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/718291525782654010/Health-care-waste-management-plan,D29870060,63,,,,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because good health increases the economic productivity of individuals and the economic growth rate of countries, investing in health is one means of accelerating development. More important, good health is a goal in itself. During the past forty years life expectancy in the developing world has risen and child mortality has decreased, sometimes dramatically. But progress is only one side of the picture. The toll from childhood and tropical diseases remains high even as new problems - including AIDS and the diseases of aging populations - appear on the scene. And all countries are struggling with the problems of controlling health expenditures and making health care accessible to the broad population. This report examines the controversial questions surrounding health care and health policy. Its findings are based in large part on innovative research, including estimation of the global burden of disease and the cost-effectiveness of interventions. These assessments can help in setting priorities for health spending. The report advocates a threefold approach to health policy for governments in developing countries and in the formerly socialist countries. First, to foster an economic environment that will enable households to improve their own health. Policies for economic growth that ensure income gains for the poor are essential. So, too, is expanded investment in schooling, particulary for girls. Second, redirect government spending away from specialized care and toward such low-cost and highly effective activities such as immunization, programs to combat micronutrient deficiencies, and control and treatment of infectious diseases. By adopting the packages of public health measures and essential clinical care dsecribed in the report, developing countries could reduce their burden of disease by 25 percent. Third, encourage greater diversity and competition in the provision of health services by decentralizing government services, promoting competitive procurement practices, fostering greater involvement by nongovernmental and other private organizations, and regulating insurance markets. These reforms could translate into longer, healthier, and more productive lives for people around the world, and especially for the more than 1 billion poor. As in previous editions, this report includes the World Development Indicators, which give comprehensive, current data on social and economic development in more than 200 countries and territories.","World Development Indicators,World development report",World development report 1993 : investing in health,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/723201468335683322/pdf/121830WDR0JAPANESE0Box74476B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/723201468335683322/text/121830WDR0JAPANESE0Box74476B01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/1993/10/12711810/world-development-report-1993-investing-health,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/723201468335683322/World-development-report-1993-investing-in-health,1993/10/12711810/World-development-report-1993-investing-in-health,723201468335683322,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/723201468335683322/World-development-report-1993-investing-in-health,D12711810,339,"Berkley, Seth","Bobadilla,Jose Luis","(Historic)Primary health, including reproductive health, child health and health,(Historic)Non-sector specific",,,"Hecht,Robert M.","Hill, Kenneth","Jamison,Dean T.","Murray, Christopher J.

At least 7 million pregnancies result in stillbirths or infant deaths within the first week of life, also because of maternal health problems. The death of a woman of reproductive age translates into substantial economic and social hardship for her family and community. Most pregnant women receive insufficient prenatal care or none at all and deliver without access to skilled obstetrical care when complications develop. Even in countries with relatively well-developed health systems, preventable maternal illness and death persist because of inadequate management of the complications of pregnancy. To assist policymakers and program managers to design and implement programs to reduce maternal mortality, this paper discusses the lessons for reducing maternal mortality derived from experience and research in both developing and industrial countries. That evidence shows that community-based approaches such as family planning and training and the deployment of midwives have helped reduce maternal deaths in high-mortality settings.

Seventy percent of deaths due to cancer occur in low-and middle-income countries, which are often poorly prepared to deal with the growing burden of chronic disease. Over a period of 18 months, the cancer care and control South-South knowledge exchange brought together a group of stakeholders from five countries in Africa - Botswana, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia to share experiences, lessons, and good practices through a set of video conferences and a site visit to Zambia. All five countries have demonstrated commitment, initiated various cancer control and cancer screening programs, and expressed interest in sharing their experiences. The knowledge exchange on cancer care and control aimed to raise awareness, increase knowledge of effective strategies, and strengthen regional collaboration in cancer control planning and expanding equitable access to cancer treatment. This paper presents highlights of the country experiences shared, common challenges discussed, and innovative solutions explored during the knowledge exchange. Topics addressed include population-based surveillance and data collection to better document the burden of cancer; strategies for designing and implementing successful national cancer care and control programs; innovative approaches for strengthening cancer prevention efforts such as human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination programs; task sharing and other strategies to build capacity and increase access to services; analytical tools for understanding the costs of programs; financing models, including public private partnerships, to increase cancer prevention and care; policy reforms needed to improve access to palliative care; and opportunities for regional collaboration.","Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) discussion paper",Cancer care and control South-South knowledge exchange,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/221191467992777343/pdf/100898-REVISED-WP-PUBLIC-Box394832B-Cancer-Care.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/221191467992777343/text/100898-REVISED-WP-PUBLIC-Box394832B-Cancer-Care.txt,/research/2015/11/25465334/cancer-care-control-south-south-knowledge-exchange,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/221191467992777343/Cancer-care-and-control-South-South-knowledge-exchange,2015/11/25465334/cancer-care-control-south-south-knowledge-exchange,221191467992777343,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/221191467992777343/Cancer-care-and-control-South-South-knowledge-exchange,D25465334,54,"Schneidman,Miriam","Jeffers,Joanne Bennett",,,,"Duncan, Kalina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

address four questions: (1) how is the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and road traffic injuries (RTIs) changing the epidemiology of Sub-Saharan Africa (2) What determines and drives this burden, and what are the commonalities with communicable diseases (3) What is the rationale for public intervention (4) How could resource-constrained governments approach NCD prevention and treatment and road safety in a comprehensive, effective and efficient way The data show that action against NCDs and RTIs in Sub-Saharan Africa is needed, together with continued efforts to address communicable diseases and maternal and child health as well as to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The report suggests that NCDs and RTIs should not be tackled separately as a vertical program, nor should they displace communicable diseases as priorities. Instead, given resource constraints, and some shared determinants, characteristics, and interventions, there is scope for an integrated approach focusing on functions (prevention, treatment, and care) rather than on disease categories. Examples are cited of potential opportunities to integrate and add NCD prevention and treatment into existing services and programs. Proven, cost-effective, prevention interventions are clearly needed, many of which (such as tobacco and alcohol taxes, road safety measures, and fuel-efficient ventilated cook-stoves) require action beyond the health sector. These can deliver broader development benefits in addition to their benefits for health. Selective, evidence-based actions to reduce NCDs and RTIs will address the changing disease burden in Africa and achieve a more sustainable improvement in health outcomes, more efficient use of resources, and better equity across patients and populations.",,The challenge of non-communicable diseases and road traffic injuries in Sub-Saharan Africa : an overview,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/844381468209068874/pdf/792930WP0WB0NC0l0Box07929300PUBLIC0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/844381468209068874/text/792930WP0WB0NC0l0Box07929300PUBLIC0.txt,/research/2013/06/17997739/challenge-non-communicable-diseases-road-traffic-injuries-sub-saharan-africa-overview,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/844381468209068874/The-challenge-of-non-communicable-diseases-and-road-traffic-injuries-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-an-overview,2013/06/17997739/challenge-non-communicable-diseases-road-traffic-injuries-sub-saharan-africa-overview,844381468209068874,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/844381468209068874/The-challenge-of-non-communicable-diseases-and-road-traffic-injuries-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-an-overview,D17997739,108,"Marquez, Patricio V.","Farrington, Jill L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Government and donor efforts to extend this progress continue but in some cases with diminished effectiveness. At the same time, new health concerns challenge the region. Public health systems now face seemingly intractable problems associated with noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and the emergence of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Funding from governments and donors has continued to flow into the health sector, but outcomes commensurate with the investment have been elusive. The sense is growing that new approaches are needed to address core health issues in the region.

The task is to transform the economy-dominated by central planning, price controls, and extensive state ownership-into a genuine market economy. The process will take years and billions of dollars. After security has been achieved and remnants of the former regime have been eradicated, a postwar economic strategy needs to be developed and implemented. Iraq can be seen as the newest addition to the group of transition economies. Baathist Iraq modeled its economy on Eastern European communism, including central planning, price controls, and extensive state ownership. In the 1960s Iraq collectivized its agriculture. Just like the transition economies of the 1990s, Iraq faces immense economic challenges.",The newsletter about reforming economies,Transition 14 (4-6),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/386761468253198087/pdf/284250English0Transition014014161.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/386761468253198087/text/284250English0Transition014014161.txt,/research/2003/06/3490096/transition-14-4-6,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/386761468253198087/Transition-14-4-6,2003/06/3490096/transition-14-4-6,386761468253198087,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/386761468253198087/Transition-14-4-6,D3490096,44,"Bartholomew,Ann","Barysch, Katinka",,Middle East and North Africa,,"Berglöf, Erik","Fries, Steven","Fuenzalida-Puelma, Hernan Luis","Fulin, Chi","Guriev,Sergei M.","Hayhurst, David","Lister,Stephen","McKee, Martin",Construction sites; Transition economy; Ownership structure; Market economy; Central planning; Price controls; Agriculture; Human resources; Oil reserves; Industry activities; Oil exports; Gross domestic product; Child mortality; School enrollment; Macroeconomic management; Donor assistance; Tariff structure; Stock exchange; Health care; Civil society; Investment climate; Political reform; Corporate governance,,,"Mountfield,Edward",,"Nguyen,Minh Van","Ofer,Gur","Ovseiko, Pavel","Pajuste, Anete","Polanec,Saso","Shakarishvili,George","Stern,Nicholas H.","Taheri,Amir","Yudaeva,Ksenia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project aims to: a) improve health and nutrition over the short-term; and b) assist in the formulation of sustainable policies and programs in the social sectors over the medium term. The project contains four components: 1) institutional development; 2) sub-project implementation; 3) establishment of a living standards measurement survey (LSMS); and 4) development of a policy framework in the health sector. The first component assists in the development of the Social Impact Amelioration Program (SIMAP) Agency. The second component addresses basic health, nutrition, water and sanitation needs of the groups affected by the economic decline, especially pregnant and lactating women and children under age five. Financing is provided for: i) rehabilitation of primary health care facilities; ii) nutrition education and food distribution programs; iii) construction of day care centers; and iv) installation of basic water supply facilities.

Debido a que la buena salud aumenta la productividad econ&#243;mica de las personas y la tasa de crecimiento econ&#243;mico de los pa&#237;ses, invertir en salud es uno de los medios para acelerar el desarrollo. Y lo que es m&#225;s importante a&#250;n, la buena salud es un objetivo en s&#237; mismo. Durante los &#250;ltimos 40 a&#241;os la esperanza de vida en el mundo en desarrollo aument&#243; y la mortalidad infantil disminuy&#243;, a veces de modo espectacular. Pero el progreso es solo una cara de la moneda. El n&#250;mero de v&#237;ctimas de enfermedades infantiles y tropicales sigue siendo alto incluso cuando aparecen en la escena nuevos problemas, como el sida y las enfermedades del envejecimiento de la poblaci&#243;n. Y todos los pa&#237;ses est&#225;n luchando con los problemas del control de los gastos de salud y la accesibilidad de la atenci&#243;n sanitaria para la poblaci&#243;n general. Este informe examina las cuestiones controvertidas que rodean el cuidado de la salud y las pol&#237;ticas sanitarias. Sus conclusiones se basan en gran parte en la investigaci&#243;n innovadora, incluida la estimaci&#243;n de la carga mundial de morbilidad y la eficacia en funci&#243;n del costo de las intervenciones. Estas evaluaciones pueden ayudar a establecer prioridades para el gasto en salud. En el informe se promueve un triple enfoque de las pol&#237;ticas de salud para los Gobiernos de los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo y de los antiguos pa&#237;ses socialistas. En primer lugar, fomentar un entorno econ&#243;mico que permitir&#225; a los hogares mejorar su propia salud. Resultan indispensables pol&#237;ticas de crecimiento econ&#243;mico que aseguren mayores ingresos para los pobres. As&#237; lo es tambi&#233;n la ampliaci&#243;n de las inversiones en educaci&#243;n, especialmente para las ni&#241;as. En segundo lugar, reorientar el gasto p&#250;blico lejos de la atenci&#243;n especializada y hacia un tipo de actividades de bajo costo y altamente eficaces como la inmunizaci&#243;n, los programas para combatir las deficiencias de micronutrientes y el control y tratamiento de enfermedades infecciosas. Mediante la adopci&#243;n de los paquetes de medidas de salud p&#250;blica y atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica b&#225;sica descriptos en el informe, los pa&#237;ses en desarrollo podr&#225;n reducir su carga de morbilidad en un 25%. En tercer lugar, fomentar una mayor diversidad y la competencia en la prestaci&#243;n de los servicios de salud mediante la descentralizaci&#243;n de los servicios p&#250;blicos, la promoci&#243;n de las pr&#225;cticas competitivas de adquisiciones, el fomento de una mayor participaci&#243;n de las organizaciones no gubernamentales y otras organizaciones privadas, y la regulaci&#243;n de los mercados de seguros. Estas reformas se podr&#225;n traducir en una vida m&#225;s larga, m&#225;s saludable y m&#225;s productiva para las personas de todo el mundo, y especialmente para los m&#225;s de 1.000 millones de pobres.

Puisqu&#8217;&#234;tre en bonne sant&#233; augmente la productivit&#233; &#233;conomique des individus et le taux de croissance &#233;conomique des pays, l&#8217;investissement dans la sant&#233; constitue donc un moyen d&#8217;acc&#233;l&#233;rer le d&#233;veloppement. Plus important encore, la sant&#233; constitue un objectif en soi. Les quarante derni&#232;res ann&#233;es ont vu l&#8217;esp&#233;rance de vie augmenter dans le monde en d&#233;veloppement et la mortalit&#233; infantile diminuer, parfois m&#234;me de mani&#232;re spectaculaire. Mais ce progr&#232;s n&#8217;est qu&#8217;une facette de la r&#233;alit&#233;. Le nombre de d&#233;c&#232;s dus aux maladies infantiles et tropicales reste &#233;lev&#233;, alors m&#234;me que de nouveaux probl&#232;mes &#8211; notamment le SIDA et les maladies touchant les populations &#226;g&#233;es &#8211; font leur apparition. Tous les pays sont confront&#233;s aux probl&#232;mes de contr&#244;le des d&#233;penses de sant&#233; et d&#8217;accessibilit&#233; de l&#8217;ensemble de la population aux soins de sant&#233;. Ce rapport examine les questions pr&#234;tant &#224; controverse concernant les soins de sant&#233; et les politiques de sant&#233;. Ses conclusions reposent en grande partie sur une recherche innovatrice, notamment l&#8217;estimation du fardeau mondial des maladies et le rapport co&#251;t-efficacit&#233; des interventions. Ces &#233;valuations peuvent aider &#224; &#233;tablir des priorit&#233;s en mati&#232;re de d&#233;penses pour la sant&#233;. Le rapport pr&#233;conise, &#224; l&#8217;intention des gouvernements de pays en d&#233;veloppement ainsi que d&#8217;anciens pays socialistes, une approche &#224; trois angles d&#8217;attaque concernant les politiques de sant&#233;. Il s&#8217;agit tout d&#8217;abord de mettre en place un environnement &#233;conomique qui permette aux m&#233;nages d&#8217;am&#233;liorer eux-m&#234;mes leur sant&#233;, Il est essentiel de poursuivre une politique de croissance &#233;conomique qui assure des gains de revenus aux pauvres. Il faut de m&#234;me investir davantage dans la scolarisation, en particulier des filles. Il s&#8217;agit ensuite de redistribuer les d&#233;penses publiques de sant&#233; en faveur d&#8217;activit&#233;s &#224; meilleur rapport co&#251;t-efficacit&#233;, comme les vaccinations, les programmes de lutte contre les carences en micronutriments, et de contr&#244;le et traitement des maladies infectieuses, plut&#244;t que pour financer des soins sp&#233;cialis&#233;s. L&#8217;adoption des trains de r&#233;formes de sant&#233; publiques et des soins cliniques essentiels d&#233;crits dans le rapport devrait permettre aux pays en d&#233;veloppement de r&#233;duire de 25 % le fardeau des maladies. Il s&#8217;agit enfin de promouvoir une diversit&#233; et une concurrence accrues dans la fourniture des services de sant&#233;, en d&#233;centralisant les services publics, en encourageant des pratiques de passation de march&#233;s concurrentielles, en renfor&#231;ant la participation d&#8217;organisations non gouvernementales et autres organismes priv&#233;s et en r&#233;glementant les march&#233;s de l&#8217;assurance. Ces r&#233;formes pourraient permettre &#224; de nombreuses personnes, en particulier au plus d&#8217;un milliard de pauvres dans le monde entier, de mener une vie plus longue, plus saine et plus productive.

Some of the negative impacts and mitigation measures include: there should be separate schedules and separate collection times for different colour-coded containers. Separate vehicles should be used for different types of waste. This is to avoid increased possibilities of wastes becoming mixed and being transported to the wrong disposal routes and sites; transportation must be done only by accredited Waste Management Contractors and certified by the local authority, ENA and other relevant departments; HCW must be transported directly to the disposal or treatment site within the shortest possible time; treatment and disposal of HCW should focus in minimizing negative impacts on health and on the environment; capacity building of health facilities workers in the all the areas related to health-care waste management should be performed at all levels; segregation system should be uniformly applied throughout the country and should be maintained throughout the entire waste cycle up to disposal; and domestic waste should be dealt separately from health waste.",,"Gambia, The - Maternal and Child Nutrition and Health Results Project : environmental assessment : National health care waste management plan",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/602311468252304608/pdf/E47610P154007000Box385451B00PUBLIC0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/602311468252304608/text/E47610P154007000Box385451B00PUBLIC0.txt,/projects/documents/2015/03/24096820/gambia-maternal-child-nutrition-health-results-project-environmental-assessment-national-health-care-waste-management-plan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/602311468252304608/National-health-care-waste-management-plan,2015/03/24096820/gambia-maternal-child-nutrition-health-results-project-environmental-assessment-national-health-care-waste-management-plan,602311468252304608,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/602311468252304608/National-health-care-waste-management-plan,D24096820,114,,,"Health,Other social services",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,West Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It reviews the medical service organization and utilization, training of health manpower and cost and finance of health expenditure from brigade to province and illustrates this with a case study of Qufu county. It is a county of great historical and cultural significance (the birthplace of Confucious). This leads to the discussion of emerging health issues as a consequence of the improvement of health care delivery, improvement of population coverage together with social economic changes since liberation. New demands on health service facilities, training and health management are emerging as a result of the ""epidemiologic transition,"" population changes and agricultural reform. Finally, it discusses how the health officials propose to address these issues and whether the cost for implementation of the new policies are feasible.","Population, Health and Nutrition Department technical notes,no.

Achieving thee objectives will protect the Russian population and economy from uncontrolled epidemics of TB, HIV/AIDS, and other epiemiologically important sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The project supports the development and large-scale implementation of interventions that are based on up-to-date scientific evidence. In that context, the major project inputs will be directed at updating and/or dissemination of strategies, guidelines and protocols; assessment of needs as a basis for effective planning, monitoring, and evaluation; training and on-the-job learning to improve the local capacity for effective implementation; supply of equipment and consumables required to improve the technical quality of diagnostic and therapeutic activities; and close attention to project monitoring and evaluation. These comprise the three major components of the project.

With twenty commissioned background studies, more than thirty case studies, visits to twenty one provinces in China, the report proposes practical, concrete steps toward a value-based integrated service model of healthcare financing and delivery, including: 1) Creating a new model of people-centered quality integrated health care that strengthens primary care as the core of the health system; 2) Continuously improve health care quality, establish an effective coordination mechanism, and actively engage all stakeholders and professional bodies to oversee improvements in quality and performance; 3) Empowering patients with knowledge and understanding of health services, so that there is more trust in the system and patients are actively engaged in their healthcare decisions; 4) Reforming public hospitals, so that they focus on complicated cases and delegate routine care to primary-care providers; 5) Changing incentives for providers, so they are rewarded for good patient health outcomes instead of the number of medical procedures used or drugs sold; 6) Boosting the status of the health workforce, especially primary-care providers, so they are better paid and supported to ensure a competent health workforce aligned with the new delivery system; 7) Allowing qualified private health providers to deliver cost-effective services and compete on a level playing field with the public sector, with the right regulatory oversight; and 8) Prioritizing public investments according to the burden of disease, where people live, and the kind of care people need on a daily basis.",,Healthy China : Deepening Health Reform in China : Building High-Quality and Value-Based Service Delivery,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/690791553844042874/pdf/Deepening-Health-Reform-in-China-Building-High-Quality-and-Value-Based-Service-Delivery.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/690791553844042874/text/Deepening-Health-Reform-in-China-Building-High-Quality-and-Value-Based-Service-Delivery.txt,/research/2019/03/30941577/healthy-china-deepening-health-reform-china-building-high-quality-value-based-service-delivery,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/690791553844042874/Deepening-Health-Reform-in-China-Building-High-Quality-and-Value-Based-Service-Delivery,2019/03/30941577/healthy-china-deepening-health-reform-china-building-high-quality-value-based-service-delivery,690791553844042874,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/690791553844042874/Deepening-Health-Reform-in-China-Building-High-Quality-and-Value-Based-Service-Delivery,D30941577,413,,,,East Asia and Pacific,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"978-1-4648-1263-7,978-1-4648-1323-8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imbalanced economic growth, political turbulence, and a greatly weakened health care system have led to declining health and significant inequalities in health status across the population. In addition, Ukraine has the fastest rate of depopulation in Europe. Driven largely by low fertility rates, this is rapidly changing the age structure of the population with higher proportions in the mid and older age groups. As is expected, non communicable diseases mortality and morbidity are now a large share of Ukraine's disease burden and more importantly so among the working age male population with significant economic and social consequences. Such a change in the composition of the burden of disease requires a multi-sectoral approach to disease prevention and management. This report shows Ukraine's divergence in mortality and morbidity trends from Central Europe and reviews policies and reforms in Central European countries that could explain in part the differing trends. It shows that excess deaths especially among working age males, are due to modifiable behavioral risk-factors such as hypertension, alcohol and smoking. Despite the amenable nature of deaths and evidence of cost-effective targeted interventions that could work, the Ukrainian health system still designed for acute care episodic disease management is not equipped to deal with this mortality crisis. Though several reforms have been proposed and some have even been legislated, most have not been implemented. What is evident is that while a focus on primary care and multi-sectoral targeted cost effective interventions to prevent and control non-communicable diseases is essential; this will be difficult and less effective in the absence of substantial reform in the health system.",Health and demography,An avoidable tragedy : combating Ukraine's health crisis - lessons from Europe,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/861121468143396769/pdf/518290WP0P112810Box342050B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/861121468143396769/text/518290WP0P112810Box342050B01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2009/01/11409065/avoidable-tragedy-combating-ukraines-health-crisis-lessons-europe,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/861121468143396769/An-avoidable-tragedy-combating-Ukraines-health-crisis-lessons-from-Europe,2009/01/11409065/avoidable-tragedy-combating-ukraines-health-crisis-lessons-europe,861121468143396769,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/861121468143396769/An-avoidable-tragedy-combating-Ukraines-health-crisis-lessons-from-Europe,D11409065,66,,,"Health,Non-compulsory health finance",Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-966-8869-21-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although some of the benefits of open data initiatives have been assessed in the past, particularly their economic and financial returns, it is often more difficult to evaluate their social and political impacts. In the public sector, a murky theory of change has emerged that links the use of open government data with greater government accountability as well as improved service delivery in key sectors, including health and education, among others. In the absence of cross-country empirical research on this topic, this paper asks the following: Based on the evidence available, to what extent and for what reasons is the use of open government data associated with higher levels of accountability and improved service delivery in developing countries To answer this question, the paper constructs a unique data set that operationalizes open government data, government accountability, service delivery, as well as other intervening and control variables. Relying on data from 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the paper finds a number of significant associations between open government data, accountability, and service delivery. However, the findings suggest differentiated effects of open government data across the health and education sectors, as well as with respect to service provision and service delivery outcomes. Although this early research has limitations and does not attempt to establish a purely causal relationship between the variables, it provides initial empirical support for claims about the efficacy of open government data for improving accountability and service delivery.","Policy Research working paper,no.

Following a slow implementation, and very limited disbursements during the initial project years, the project was simplified and restructured. Lessons learned include the following: A realistic assessment of the environment for project implementation is crucial. Large investments in equipment and in training worked better when services address major health issues where significant gaps existed in terms of staff skills and technical level of facilities. Complex policy changes or investments in complex technical systems barely worked, with difficulties in implementation and a modest impact. The implementation of changes has to be facilitated by properly timed and designed public information activities. Changes of policy and regulatory environment in areas where vested interests are significant does not work due to collusion among players against changes, and a high potential for corruption. More involvement of local experts and end users would better match the characteristics of the goods and services provided to the specific needs and conditions, and would also require an adequate planning of resources for local consulting services. The procurement of equipment and consumables from UNICEF was not a good experience. Time and effort were spent in the procurement of goods because there were numerous packages for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), international shopping (IS), and national shopping (NS). Better procurement planning and packaging at the project preparation phase would improve economy and efficiency in the procurement process. Both the Bank and the Borrower paid insufficient attention to the setup, maintenance, and systematic use of a monitoring and evaluation framework.",,Macedonia - Health Sector Transition Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515781468773101122/pdf/25735.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515781468773101122/text/25735.txt,/projects/documents/2003/04/2403320/macedonia-health-sector-transition-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515781468773101122/Macedonia-Health-Sector-Transition-Project,2003/04/2403320/Macedonia-Health-Sector-Transition-Project,515781468773101122,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515781468773101122/Macedonia-Health-Sector-Transition-Project,D2403320,36,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Health,Non-compulsory health finance",World,,,,,,,,,,Financial Management and Information System;average length of stay;primary care;maternal and child;medical equipment and supplies;Rational Use of Drugs;primary health care services;maternal and child health;vaccine need;financial management information system;financial management and control;quality at entry;public information campaign;procurement of drugs;principal performance ratings;primary care physician;active case detection;primary care doctor;national drug policy;hepatitis b vaccine;evidence based practice;primary care personnel;passive case detection;ratings of bank;distribution of drug;high risk group;cervical cancer screening;reproductive health service;health service provider;prevention of tuberculosis;external technical assistance;ischemic heart disease;exchange rate;Exchange Rates;burden of disease;primary care sector;cost accounting system;improvements in management;High Blood Pressure;adverse drug reaction;quality control laboratory;distribution of pharmaceuticals;bank supervision missions;administration of contract;public health perspective;health system management;institutional development impact;project time frame;quality assurance standard;procurement and distribution;procurement pharmaceutical;financial information system;competitive bidding procedure;methods of payment;national health insurance;health financing reform;issue of access;primary care services;international good practice;health sector institutions;life long learning;human resource issues;health care management;public sector provider;law and regulation;volume of procurement;perinatal mortality rate;family medicine practice;number of candidates;lack of evidence;outputs by components;development of hospital;social health insurance;institutional strengthening;perinatal health services;areas of health;health financing system;public opinion survey;social marketing technique;health care institutions;cost of training;health reform;patient choice;Essential Drugs;prevention program;Fiscal Sustainability;health finance;professional association;payment system;Health Economics;borrower performance;health facility;basic benefit;pharmaceutical procurement;capitation payment;interest group;Perinatal Care;healthcare provider;payment arrangement;tb control;adjustment operation;project plan;medical center;provider payment;public provider;capitation contract;pharmaceutical supply;information center;international tender;reference price;international procurement;local capacity;hospital administrator;foreign consultant;payment mechanism;local expert;budget resource;drug legislation;drug list;pediatric clinic;promotional material;dramatic reduction;Continuing Education;reimbursement system;pilot program;general practitioner;neonatal death;civil works;laboratory equipment;credit funds;hospital management;pharmaceutical policy;investment operation;aids incidence;general hospitals;policy option;policy study;health network;women's health;tuberculosis prevention;sexually-transmitted disease;health expenditure;healthcare management;fee policy;Vocational Training;pay hospital;management skill;data transfer;high ratio;chronically ill;macedonian denar;Disease Prevention;joint financing;diagnostic system;electronic linkage;expert recommendation;advocacy campaign;medical directors;facility management;application software;Employment Services;educational curriculum;price reduction;assessment method;long-term training;evaluation committee;procurement staff;education systems;national implementation;cash benefit;intensive training;local training;clinical training;allocative efficiency;organizational change;competitive procurement;tertiary hospitals;physical environment;pharmaceutical sector;public accountability;procurement practice;adjustment lending;international tendering;coherent strategy;legislative change;local law;media campaign;global budget;educational technology;technical expertise;emergency procurement;finance reform;Infectious Disease;teaching module;assets management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The provision of primary health is one in which women play an important role, especially in rural areas. This paper will examine some of the constraints to and approaches for increasing the participation of women in the primary health care, population, and nutrition activities of Bank financed projects. The paper begins with a brief consideration of women's roles and health problems. It follows with a discussion of the constraints and project approaches and provides illustrations from appraisal reports for some related projects. It concludes by suggesting what the design of health programs should recognize: (a) problems women face in obtaining health care; (b) special health problems of women from the household or occupational environment; (c) the need to mobilize women not only as passive recipients but as active providers of health care; and (d) the need for health education to reach women as providers of health care.","Notes on women in development,no.

The lessons learned indicate that the demand-responsive and community-based approach to service provision introduced by the project; ensures the sustainability of water schemes in rural areas provided that : (i) the system is simple to operate and maintain (simple technology covering a limited number of people and villages), (ii) the social fabric is cohesive among beneficiaries; and (iii) the WUA/local organizations receive sufficient training and support during the operational phase until they are capable of managing the scheme both technically and financially. Different water supply technologies and management models need to be considered according to local conditions. The approach successfully adopted under the project - based on a local source of groundwater and a simple Rural Water Supply (RWS) system serving and managed by a Water Users Association (WUA) - is reaching its limits. To reap the full health benefits of RWS schemes, future RWS projects in Morocco should ensure that the MOH has the means to fulfill its responsibilities vis-�is water quality (chemical and bacteriological test of drinking water, sanitary conditions of water points) and hygiene education. Good donor coordination from project design to completion, (i) ensured that the approach followed to improve the access to safe water in rural areas was the same throughout the country; (ii) allowed to allocate considerable resources to the sector; and (iii) help refined project design and implementation by sharing views and experiences. Project benefits for women and girls were high (i.e. time savings and less physical burden fetching water, increase school attendance of rural girls).

Possible environmental issues are (i) possible impacts on local ecology and settlements; (ii) the potential for increased off-take of water from some water sources; (iii) ecological disturbance associated with the construction phase of rehabilitation and extension of the water supply and sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants; and (iv) the potential for bacteriological contamination if water or sludge from the wastewater treatment plants are used for agricultural purposes. Other environmental impacts include pollution during construction, damage to earth structure and soil, destruction or displacement of flora and fauna in ecologically sensitive areas and disposal of waste materials.",,Azerbaijan - Additional Financing for the Second National Water Supply and Sanitation Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 5) : Environmental impact assessment report for Shabran Rayon,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402031467995092287/pdf/E43730V50REV0S00Box382169B00PUBLIC0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402031467995092287/text/E43730V50REV0S00Box382169B00PUBLIC0.txt,/projects/documents/2013/12/19210271/azerbaijan-additional-financing-second-national-water-supply-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-5-environmental-impact-assessment-report-shabran-rayon,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402031467995092287/Environmental-impact-assessment-report-for-Shabran-Rayon,2013/12/19210271/azerbaijan-additional-financing-second-national-water-supply-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-5-17-environmental-impact-assessment-report-shabran-rayon,402031467995092287,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402031467995092287/Environmental-impact-assessment-report-for-Shabran-Rayon,D19210271,144,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Water Supply,Wastewater Treatment and Disposal,Wastewater Collection and Transportation",Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,Eastern Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With transmission of the polio virus substantially slowing in the Africa region, the only two countries worldwide with ongoing endemic polio transmission may soon be Pakistan and Afghanistan. A substantial number of the polio cases or infant paralysis occurring in Afghanistan is linked to cross-border transmission from Pakistan. The ongoing cycle of polio infection is not just a tragedy for the children of Pakistan, it is a global public health emergency constituting one of the final barriers to permanently eradicating polio. This paper demonstrates clear economic benefits and efficacy of the National Immunization Support Project (NISP), which is financing interventions in terms of DALYs saved, and establishes that this approach is affordable and economically effective with a high rate of return. In addition to increased investment, the effectiveness of the Expanded Program on Immunization can be enhanced by improving the capacity building of health professionals, as well as by improving logistics of program interventions to reach marginalized populations, remote areas, and pockets of resistance. An increased financial investment alone will be insufficient to address the root causes of persistent under-coverage of immunization in Pakistan. It is imperative that ample attention and resources be diverted to strengthen the procurement systems, local and provincial management capacity, and reporting mechanisms, among other capacity improvements.","Health, Nutrition and Population (HNP) discussion paper",The Pakistan Expanded Program on Immunization and the National Immunization Support Project : an economic analysis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/264971484109785001/pdf/111815-WP-PAKImmunizationEA-PUBLIC.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/264971484109785001/text/111815-WP-PAKImmunizationEA-PUBLIC.txt,/research/2016/11/27086014/pakistan-expanded-program-immunization-national-immunization-support-project-economic-analysis,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/264971484109785001/The-Pakistan-Expanded-Program-on-Immunization-and-the-National-Immunization-Support-Project-an-economic-analysis,2017/01/27086014/pakistan-expanded-program-immunization-national-immunization-support-project-economic-analysis,264971484109785001,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/264971484109785001/The-Pakistan-Expanded-Program-on-Immunization-and-the-National-Immunization-Support-Project-an-economic-analysis,D27086014,66,"Haque,Minhaj Ul","Waheed,Muhammad",,South Asia,,"Masud,Tayyeb","Malick, Wasim Shahid","Yunus,Hammad","Rekhi,Rahul","Oelrichs,Robert","Kucheryavenko,Oleg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its goal is to provide two of the most fundamental human needs - safe water and sanitary disposal of human wastes - to all people. Since the technology for supplying water is better understood, the emphasis in this volume is on sanitation and waste reclamation technologies, their contributions to better health, and how they are affected by water service levels and the ability an willingness of communities to pay for the systems. This manual presents the latest field results of the research, summarizes selected portions of other publication on sanitation program planning, and describes the engineering details of alternative sanitation technologies and how they can be upgraded. The guidelines, procedures, and technologies are based on the World Bank's own research in nineteen countries. The twenty-two chapters are divided into three parts: socioeconomic aspects of sanitation program planning, sanitation program planning, and sanitation technology options.

The key lessons learned include: Alignment of project and government political, and continuity in reform objectives are critical for project success. Confidence and communication among agencies and the Bank are critical. The administrative principle of unit operation works better than the functional principle. Adequate and consistent policy on selection, training, and motivation of unit's staff is important for unit efficiency. The involvement of the regional structures of Bulgarian Medical Association, Regional Health Insurance Fund, and Regional Health Center and in decision-making relating to the selection of practices under primary health care subject to repair and equipment contributed to the fair and smooth process of allocating the offers. The investments made in the emergency medical system influenced significantly the mortality rate in emergency cases. The restructuring of blood transfusion system is part of the overall restructuring of the health sector and in-patient care in particular. People's motivation to donate blood is in direct relationship to the economic state of the country and to the development of civil society.

Although the project will be mostly beneficial in restoring ecosystems, which in turn improves micro-climate, and air quality, negative environmental impacts feature the deterioration of water quality, and dried delta lakes, resulting from discontinued inflows from NAS, with concomitant impacts on fisheries, aggravated by the fluctuating sea levels which may potentially delay the establishment of infrastructure, fishing industries, and tourism development. This environmental assessment include mitigation measures as follows. Strict discipline in water consumption, and management practices should be maintained, including improved water pricing, and safe disposal of polluted water drainage; in addition, potential drainage water uses will be researched. Construction of a dike across the Berg Strait will stabilize water levels, and contribute to reduced salinity levels around NAS. Construction, and rehabilitation of weirs in the Syr Darya delta, should improve water intakes from supply canals to the lakes, and, local embankments should protect agricultural lands from

The pilot focuses on the vaccine market, where research, development and production of vaccines specific to the needs of the poorest developing countries are limited by the small number of manufacturers, high cost of product development and capacity scale-up, and demand uncertainty. The pilot Advance Market Commitment (AMC) principal goal is to accelerate the creation of a viable market for pneumococcal vaccines for developing countries, by providing up-front financing to cover capital costs associated with the development of additional vaccine production capacity to meet demand from developing countries. The pilot's focus is pneumococcal vaccines, for which the key technological issues have been resolved and there is substantial demand in poor developing countries. Pneumonial infections are the largest killer of children in Africa and worldwide and pneumococcal infections are the largest cause of pneumonia deaths. The specific design of the AMC pilot is intended to: a) spur development of vaccines needed in developing countries; b) foster and accelerate dedicated production capacity scale-up; c) provide a predictable and sustainable long-term price; and d) address the high demand risk and demand uncertainty faced by the vaccine industry.",,Pilot advance market commitment for vaccines against pneumococcal diseases,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/965621468134712980/pdf/468870BR0Box331USE0ONLY10R200810259.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/965621468134712980/text/468870BR0Box331USE0ONLY10R200810259.txt,/projects/documents/2008/12/10114693/pilot-advance-market-commitment-vaccines-against-pneumococcal-diseases,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/965621468134712980/Pilot-advance-market-commitment-for-vaccines-against-pneumococcal-diseases,2008/12/10114693/pilot-advance-market-commitment-vaccines-against-pneumococcal-diseases,965621468134712980,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/965621468134712980/Pilot-advance-market-commitment-for-vaccines-against-pneumococcal-diseases,D10114693,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A secondary but important global objective would be the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through reduced gas flaring and enhanced share of cleaner generation. Some of the negative impacts of the project are: 1) loss or fragmentation of natural habitat, leading to reduction in biodiversity and possible impacts on rare or endangered specie; 2) disturbance by noise and vibration in surrounding communities; 3) alteration of surface drainage pattern leading to erosion; 4) exposure of workers and nearby communities to excessive noise from the power plant; 5) disposal of packaging materials thereby leading to soil/water pollution; and 6) spills and leaks have contaminated soil, structures, and possibly groundwater. Mitigation measures of the project are: 1) maintain equipment and facilities at optimal operating conditions as stated in the equipment operating manual, equipment with low noise rating shall be used, install noise barriers around high noise areas in the facility, periodically monitor noise levels and adhere to prescribed limits in the workplace, at the plant boundary, and in surrounding communities provide ear muffs and enforce their use enforced in high noise areas on site; 2) ensure that the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant and oil separators are optimized so that effluents meet regulatory limits before discharge; 3) ensure that solid wastes are categorized and containerized to prevent contact with soil and groundwater before being transported to disposal site; and 4) clean up and remove any wastes or contaminated soils, and maintain liaison with communities and local government on final disposition of site.",,Nigeria - Electricity and Gas Improvement Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 6) : Environmental and social management plan for PHCN-TCN transmission substation rehabilitation/re-enforcement projects under the NEGIP (Port Harcourt),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/416791468065935246/pdf/E20010v60EA0P100P106172PortHarcourt.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/416791468065935246/text/E20010v60EA0P100P106172PortHarcourt.txt,/projects/documents/2009/08/16336283/nigeria-electricity-gas-improvement-project-environmental-assessment-vol-6-environmental-social-management-plan-phcn-tcn-transmission-substation-rehabilitationre-enforcement-projects-under-negip-port-harcourt,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/416791468065935246/Environmental-and-social-management-plan-for-PHCN-TCN-transmission-substation-rehabilitation-re-enforcement-projects-under-the-NEGIP-Port-Harcourt,2009/08/16336283/nigeria-electricity-gas-improvement-project-environmental-assessment-vol-6-9-environmental-social-management-plan-phcn-tcn-transmission-substation-rehabilitationre-enforcement-projects-under-negip-port-harcourt,416791468065935246,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/416791468065935246/Environmental-and-social-management-plan-for-PHCN-TCN-transmission-substation-rehabilitation-re-enforcement-projects-under-the-NEGIP-Port-Harcourt,D16336283,37,,,Power,West Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project will ensure a minimum navigable water depth during dry seasons, thus guaranteeing an uninterrupted flow of shipping and the reclassification of the river to a third class waterway accessible to 1000 ton barges. The anticipated environmental impacts assessed by this study are as follows. Location issues include: 1) inundation management and prevention; 2) socio-economic impacts; 3) flora and fauna; and 4) impact on cultural and historical properties. Construction issues include: 1) noise; 2) soil erosion and dust; 3) atmospheric pollution; 4) surface water pollution; 5) economic impacts of construction; and 6) public health. The principle impacts on the environment include disruption of areas adjacent to the project site, soil erosion, temporary water quality decline, and air quality degradation resulting from the construction process. Impacts to terrestrial and aquatic resources appear to be minimal since the project will be located on a highly regulated waterway and will not create significantly new conditions. Potential impacts may occur due to the large labor population which the project will attract and thirteen cultural and historic sites will be affected by inundation, necessitating protection measures and excavation in some cases.","World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2",China - Guigang Multi-Purpose Navigation Project : summary environmental impact assessment : Summary EIA : Guangxi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425731468019139173/pdf/multi-page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425731468019139173/text/multi-page.txt,/projects/documents/1994/04/698473/china-guigang-multi-purpose-navigation-project-summary-environmental-impact-assessment-summary-eia-guangxi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425731468019139173/Summary-EIA-Guangxi,1994/04/698473/Summary-EIA-Guangxi,425731468019139173,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425731468019139173/Summary-EIA-Guangxi,D698473,28,Guangxi Communications Department,Zhejiang Provi,"Ports/Waterways,Sub-National Government",Asia,,,,,,,,,,Waterways; Environmental impact assessment; Socioeconomic conditions; Flora; Fauna; Noise pollution; Soil erosion; Dust; Air pollution; Water pollution; Public health; Water quality; Air quality; Historic sites & monuments; Floods; Rivers; Organizational structure; Financial policy; Market economy; Navigation; Dams; Transport; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Economic development; Inland waterways; Poverty mitigation; Labor markets; Policy reform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lessons learned indicate that a strong dialog between the Bank and the provincial government at the technical as well as the cabinet level is a key to success for a reform program. The Bank had been in a policy dialogue with the Sindh province for about one and one half years before a lending operation was formally discussed. A high level champion of the policy dialog is needed to win the commitment of technical level civil servants. The provincial Minister of Finance and the provincial Governor all sent signals to the lower levels of government which secured their cooperation with the Bank at the technical level. If solid borrower ownership of the reform program can be established, then it is advisable to provide financial support (an IDA credit) even considering the risks of lending to a sub-national government preceding an election. An accompanying TA project enhances the effectiveness of subsequent (SACs). The Sindh province reform program is comprehensive and complex and there were a number of areas where sustained expertise and capacity building were provided by a Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grant. For projects that support decentralization, it is important to assess beforehand the limits to which laws can be reformed without approval from the central government. Subsequent provincial SACs would benefit from greater donor coordination. Improved coordination will help leverage funding for priority activities in future phases of the reform program. Initially, structural adjustment programs at the provincial level should be broad-based, with increasing focus over time.",,Pakistan - Structural Adjustment Credit for the Government of Sindh Province,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/187851468775171057/text/25158.txt,/projects/documents/2003/06/2398268/pakistan-structural-adjustment-credit-government-sindh-province,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/187851468775171057/Pakistan-Structural-Adjustment-Credit-for-the-Government-of-Sindh-Province,2003/06/2398268/pakistan-structural-adjustment-credit-government-sindh-province,187851468775171057,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/187851468775171057/Pakistan-Structural-Adjustment-Credit-for-the-Government-of-Sindh-Province,D2398268,null,,,"Other Industry, Trade and Services,Sub-National Government,Primary Education,Health",South Asia,,,,,,,,,,Policy and human Resource Development;interim poverty reduction strategy;small and medium enterprise development;Administrative and Civil Service Reform;water supply and sanitation service;Community Water and Sanitation;Rural Water and Sanitation;oil and gas royalty;Regulation and Competition Policy;Tax Policy and Administration;early stage of development;country financial accountability assessment;provincial minister;public sector research institute;post board;Promoting Private Sector;quality at entry;operations and maintenance;education and health;public service delivery;financial management reform;principal performance ratings;provincial tax revenue;tb control;agriculture and irrigation;basic social service;government reform program;institutional development impact;medium-term budget framework;road user cost;Applied Economic Research;maintenance of road;structural adjustment program;reduction of poverty;poverty reducing expenditure;property tax base;medium-term expenditure framework;civil service cadre;category of assets;access to expertise;quality of education;private sector management;industry and trade;ratings of bank;list of asset;general budget support;devolution of power;road maintenance budget;public sector investment;quality of health;government primary school;institutional capacity building;economic reform program;irrigation and drainage;types of reforms;private seed company;total tax revenue;agricultural pricing policy;transfer of knowledge;electric supply corporation;road maintenance fund;return to investment;rural infrastructure development;cost of provision;confirmed polio cases;human resource management;government service delivery;fiscal policy reform;population with access;Accounts and Audit;public information campaign;outputs by components;improved service delivery;borrower performance;tranche release;Programmatic Approach;budget allocation;rolling plan;fiscal restructuring;urban service;free textbook;business community;improving governance;income poverty;fiscal situation;public expenditure;hepatitis b;urban slum;monitoring indicator;project datum;current expenditure;primary enrollment;credit proceeds;irrigation management;national reform;provincial road;fiscal management;road sector;teacher performance;severance package;road expenditure;consensus building;school budget;breeder seed;extension service;provincial development;provincial revenue;immunization service;education budget;federal grant;federal government;donor coordination;program coverage;monthly salary;provincial budget;future expenditure;stamp tax;staff salary;increasing rate;labor protection;district transfers;fiscal space;education expenditure;budgetary fund;public-private partnership;urban poor;basic infrastructure;fiscal data;civil works;local accountability;government participation;health facility;teacher competency;Labor Law;school year;primary student;rural area;routine immunization;skill mix;district hospital;irrigation charge;wage control;physical facility;outcome indicator;fiscal condition;state corporations;fuel levy;vaccination program;cost sharing;infrastructure priority;routine maintenance;health outcome;asset inventory;educating girl;private contractor;sugar mill;budget figures;large enterprise;higher growth;investment expenditure;political conflict;provincial reform;female teacher;fiscal balance;evaluation system;regulatory activity;pension obligation;regulatory regime;immunization campaign;regulatory body;regulatory service;debt service;disciplinary action;primary level;internal management;Regulatory Bodies;regulatory capacity;annual target;restructuring plan;procurement process;provincial authority;governing board;institutional impact;capacity demand;political parties;political party;significant threat;economic recovery;military government;learned lesson;channel development;social gap;Economic Management;provincial debt;exchange rate;Exchange Rates;financial discipline;farmer organization;industrial area;government ordinance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The construction of these bridges will impact on the surface water quality the impact will come from the oil that may leak into the river; the construction under water will cause silts to be suspended, the loss of abandoned construction waste or construction material, construction clay mortar and domestic wastewater near construction site. In operation period, the sewage sources are mainly locomotive depot, wastewater that contains oil discharged from production sections such as vehicle section and domestic wastewater discharged from each station. The main air pollution in construction phase will be from construction dust. After implementation of the project, the existing diesel engine traction locomotives will be replaced by electric traction locomotive. Domestic waste and train waste generated from each station and section will also increase. A new environment impact, electromagnetic pollution will occur. The local land resources will definitely be impacted due to the large amount of land acquisition and removal. Following are some of the mitigation measures: (i) the railway line will be carefully selected to avoid occupying the sensitive ecosystems; (ii) the earthworks will use the excavated earth as backfill where at all possible and minimize the occupation of farmland, cultivated land, and woodlands; (iii) vertical landscaping shall be carried out on the outer sides of the railway stations; (iv) the operation of high-level noise construction shall be 200 meters far from the residential areas, and the low-level noise equipment shall be adopted. Main construction activities shall be strictly controlled within the daytime. Temporary sound-insulation facilities shall be used to decrease the effect of mechanical noise. Construction vehicles shall be arranged to steer clear of the residential areas whenever possible. At the ZheGanLine same time, such vehicles are forbidden to go through the residential areas at night; and (v) watering shall be carried out for temporary roads that have not been laid that are built for the various railway construction site. It shall be done two times per day (one time in morning and another in afternoon) to ease the pollution of dust emissions. The number of watering shall be augmented in dry or blustery contractors Zheanline weather. Covering canvas shall be used for the transportation of cement, sand, lime, and so on.

Cleaning old mine and industrial sites is often extremely costly. Furthermore, cleaning up the sites may not result in appreciable improvements in human health or the environment. Given resource constraints, what decision rules should guide activities for remediation? Which sites should be addressed first? Which specific actions and investments are likely to provide the greatest benefits for the resources spent? This paper addresses the question of how to set priorities for environmental remediation. It offers a practical approach for selecting priority sites. And it provides a framework for choosing priority investments and activities for environmental management more broadly, if resources are not earmarked for remediation. The first part of the paper addresses setting priorities in the mining sector, and the second part addresses setting priorities for environmental management in general. While the paper focuses on Bolivian mining communities, its approach is applicable to a wide-range of problems and communities. Following the annexes is a workbook with detailed examples of how to calculate the benefits of potential investments and activities, and weigh these benefits against costs.",World Bank technical paper ; no.

The objective of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the NWSSSP is to ensure that the project proposed for World Bank financing is environmentally sound and sustainable and to ensure that the project interventions respond to requirements of the legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the World Bank Safeguard Policies. Adverse impacts of the project will mainly occur at construction/installation phases (construction phase) and , majority of these impacts will be of temporary character. The key environmental risks during construction/operation period of project are, as follows: dust, raised from the roads at construction sites and from material, carrying trucks; waste water from construction/renovation sites; generation, disposal and destruction of solid wastes; Noise generated by machinery and equipment; Use of construction materials that may damage health; Discharge of toxic substances into atmosphere during welding, painting and other works; Impact on earth structure and soils; pollution of soil layer from fuel and lubricants and/and or water pollution; earthworks, removal of extra soils and other materials; Destruction or displacement of flora and fauna in ecologically sensitive areas; and hazard to health and safety to workers, conducting construction works and population. Generally, during operation of WSS system final impact is expected to be positive. However, certain impacts on environment may be expected during operation phase of WSS system too: smell (in case wastewater treatment is not carried out according to regulations); local ecological effects of off-take of water from new sources (in cases where this occurs); impact of potable water, waste (disposed) water and sludge on environment and on human health (particularly if treated water or sludge are used for agriculture), and possible impacts of operational failures during accidents and extra-ordinary situations.",,Azerbaijan - Second National Water Supply and Sanitation Project : environment assessment (Vol. 5) : Environmental impact assessment report for Shabran Rayon,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/527421468003341227/pdf/E17810V50P10991ng0FIN0Feb02011DH111.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/527421468003341227/text/E17810V50P10991ng0FIN0Feb02011DH111.txt,/projects/documents/2010/11/13870224/azerbaijan-second-national-water-supply-sanitation-project-environment-assessment-vol-5-environmental-impact-assessment-report-shabran-rayon,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/527421468003341227/Environmental-impact-assessment-report-for-Shabran-Rayon,2017/05/13870224/azerbaijan-second-national-water-supply-sanitation-project-environment-assessment-vol-5-environmental-impact-assessment-report-shabran-rayon,527421468003341227,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/527421468003341227/Environmental-impact-assessment-report-for-Shabran-Rayon,D13870224,154,Azersu Joint Stock Company,"Mansimov , Mirzakha","Sanitation,Water Supply,Central Government (Central Agencies)",Asia,,,,,,,,,,,Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because good health increases the economic productivity of individuals and the economic growth rate of countries, investing in health is one means of accelerating development. More important, good health is a goal in itself. During the past forty years life expectancy in the developing world has risen and child mortality has decreased, sometimes dramatically. But progress is only one side of the picture. The toll from childhood and tropical diseases remains high even as new problems - including AIDS and the diseases of aging populations - appear on the scene. And all countries are struggling with the problems of controlling health expenditures and making health care accessible to the broad population. This report examines the controversial questions surrounding health care and health policy. Its findings are based in large part on innovative research, including estimation of the global burden of disease and the cost-effectiveness of interventions. These assessments can help in setting priorities for health spending. The report advocates a threefold approach to health policy for governments in developing countries and in the formerly socialist countries. First, to foster an economic environment that will enable households to improve their own health. Policies for economic growth that ensure income gains for the poor are essential. So, too, is expanded investment in schooling, particulary for girls. Second, redirect government spending away from specialized care and toward such low-cost and highly effective activities such as immunization, programs to combat micronutrient deficiencies, and control and treatment of infectious diseases. By adopting the packages of public health measures and essential clinical care dsecribed in the report, developing countries could reduce their burden of disease by 25 percent. Third, encourage greater diversity and competition in the provision of health services by decentralizing government services, promoting competitive procurement practices, fostering greater involvement by nongovernmental and other private organizations, and regulating insurance markets. These reforms could translate into longer, healthier, and more productive lives for people around the world, and especially for the more than 1 billion poor.

Industrialized countries also use medicinal plants, as many pharmaceuticals are based on, or derived from plant compounds. Over-exploitation of medicinal plants, and lack of meaningful legislation to regulate harvesting, and trade is having serious repercussions, especially for developing countries. The demand for plant-based herbal products has grown exponentially during the last several decades. While this demand might imply a resource sustainability problem, it also offers opportunities. Today, some of Africa's most disadvantaged people live in dryland regions, where in the past they maintained a vibrant culture that was essentially in dynamic equilibrium with their environment. However, with growing populations and borders that limit traditional migratory movement, the pressure on semi-arid lands has reached a critical stage, and these lands are now less able to support existing populations. Nevertheless, what looks like a problem actually provides a niche opportunity for countries with drylands to reverse land degradation, and advance rural development. The residents of these areas have always relied on the sparse endemic vegetation for their healthcare needs, and as a source of food security during famines, and droughts. The present review builds upon the recognition that such lands support a unique biota that offers local residents, important land rehabilitation and medicinal properties and values, not only for their own needs, but for an increasing global demand. These multi-purpose medicinal plants, including trees, shrubs and herbs, would not only fill both a local niche market, but also have great potential for a global market. By combining indigenous knowledge, and modern appropriate technology, communities and researchers can identify cultivation practices that offer new sustainable land management practices to halt desertification. Thus, communities can derive a greater share of the increasing global value of medicinal plants, and rehabilitate their degraded lands, both of which will improve their quality of life.",,Capitalizing on the bio-economic value of multi-purpose medicinal plants for the rehabilitation of drylands in sub-Saharan Africa,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645461468328554117/pdf/341170rev.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645461468328554117/text/341170rev.txt,/research/2005/01/6388840/capitalizing-bio-economic-value-multi-purpose-medicinal-plants-rehabilitation-drylands-sub-saharan-africa,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645461468328554117/Capitalizing-on-the-bio-economic-value-of-multi-purpose-medicinal-plants-for-the-rehabilitation-of-drylands-in-sub-Saharan-Africa,2005/01/6388840/capitalizing-bio-economic-value-multi-purpose-medicinal-plants-rehabilitation-drylands-sub-saharan-africa,645461468328554117,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645461468328554117/Capitalizing-on-the-bio-economic-value-of-multi-purpose-medicinal-plants-for-the-rehabilitation-of-drylands-in-sub-Saharan-Africa,D6388840,56,"Esikuri,Enos E.","Lambert,John D.

However, there is an overall dissatisfaction with the health system's performance, namely a deteriorated health status, declining birth rates, and increased death rates. There is inadequate prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular disease, including that for renewed epidemics of communicable diseases, i.e., tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and sexually transmitted infections, and, further concerns include the inappropriate allocation of the percentage of GDP to health care. Such performance arise from the absence of clinical protocols, and treatment methods which do not reflect effective approaches to medical care and disease prevention; from an unbalanced health care delivery; inadequate health facilities, and management systems; and, the inefficient allocation of health resources. A sustained, and wide-ranging process of gradual, planned improvements in the health care system should include fostering disease prevention, while promoting clinical practices with good medical assistance, reorganizing the system of health infrastructure into a diverse network of accredited facilities, with defined roles, commensurate technology, and accountability for clinical excellence, and effective use of resources.

The report addresses core questions for resource allocation such ""How can HIV funding be optimally allocated to the combination of HIV response interventions that will yield the highest impact"" or ""What level of investment is required to achieve national targets, if we allocate resources optimally"". The report describes epidemiological and HIV financing trends as well as identifies sub-populations, which are most affected by the epidemic. Based on this information, the optimized mix of interventions for minimizing new HIV infections and deaths is identified using mathematical modelling techniques. Required investments into programs for key populations and antiretroviral treatment are established and translated into policy recommendations. The AE analysis indicates that, using the same US 3.9 million dollars of annual programmatic HIV spending recorded in 2013, Armenia could avert an additional 290 new HIV infections and 288 AIDS-related deaths from 2015 to 2020 if these resources were allocated optimally to minimize both HIV incidence and AIDS-related deaths.",,Optimizing HIV Investments in Armenia,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/393721477990243158/pdf/Optimizing-HIV-Investments-in-Armenia.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/393721477990243158/text/Optimizing-HIV-Investments-in-Armenia.txt,/research/2016/03/26903254/optimizing-hiv-investments-armenia,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/393721477990243158/Optimizing-HIV-Investments-in-Armenia,2016/03/26903254/,393721477990243158,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/393721477990243158/Optimizing-HIV-Investments-in-Armenia,D26903254,58,"Benedikt,Clemens Johannes","Cuadros Rubio,Diego Fernando","Health,Public administration - Health,Health",Commonwealth of Independent States,,"Masaki,Emiko","Prestidge,Marelize","Obst,Michael Andreas","Heard,Wendy",,,,,,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These goals will be approached through six sub-programs: (1) expanding early childhood education; (2) ensuring access to all; (3) meeting learning needs of all; (4) reducing female illiteracy; (5) eliminating gender disparity; and (6) improving all aspects of quality education. The environmental impacts are anticipated to be small-scale, arising out of construction of small buildings and associated facilities (such as drinking water supply), albeit spread over the entire country. The impacts are all local, and relate to the health, hygiene and safety of the school children. The environmental issues in this project relate to site location and planning (natural hazards; sensitive ecological regions; arsenic contamination in the drinking water supplied in the schools; site drainage); building design and construction (indoor air quality and daylight factor inside the classrooms, sanitation facilities and waste management, water supply); and maintenance during the operation period (site cleanliness and hygiene, prevention of enteric infections). In the long-term, supply of potable water in the schools could be an issue, given the deteriorating trend of water quality in the country, as a whole. No other long-term impact is anticipated. The government of Nepal has completed an assessment of: (a) the implications of arsenic in water supply, especially in the Terai area, and testing and mitigation requirements under the project; (b) systems for ensuring and improving sanitation facilities in schools; (c) appropriate methods for site selection of school buildings, sanitation and water facilities; and (d) appropriate designs and materials for creating a good learning environment with adequate lighting, ventilation, and acoustics.",,Nepal - Eduction for All Project : environmental assessment,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/119791468775549987/text/E1084.txt,/projects/documents/2004/01/5691540/nepal-eduction-all-project-environmental-assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/119791468775549987/Nepal-Eduction-for-All-Project-environmental-assessment,2004/01/5691540/nepal-eduction-all-project-environmental-assessment,119791468775549987,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/119791468775549987/Nepal-Eduction-for-All-Project-environmental-assessment,D5691540,null,,,"Other social services,Primary Education,Literacy/Non-Formal Education,Pre-primary education,Sub-National Government",Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some lessons learned included: decentralization to the district level has the potential to improve service delivery, but it needs to be anchored within a strong institutional framework accompanied by capacity building (including on fiduciary issues) to improve the autonomy of districts and enable them to plan, budget, and better manage their programs. At the same time, sufficient attention should be given to national level policy dialogue in order to ensure continuous support and commitment to the decentralization agenda. In a challenging political environment, sufficient attention needs to be given during project design to find the right balance between innovation for impact and preconditions for reform. Preferably, for complex and innovative reforms like those involving decentralization and fiscal transfers, it is important to establish legal, policy and institutional frameworks including implementation arrangements at all levels and/or to plan to develop such capacity to carry out the assigned responsibilities effectively. It may be necessary that some progress take place on key aspects of reform during project design and before project effectiveness to ensure sufficient political commitment and momentum from the government. Projects need good monitoring and evaluation systems with clear and measurable indicators, which are clearly defined during design of the project and institutionalized to be able to systematically monitor project implementation over time. Given the long history of similar lessons from previous operations in health, there is a clear need for simple, well-designed monitoring frameworks that are owned by the government and implementable.",,Kenya - Decentralized Reproductive Health and HIV/AIDS Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/428741468046751126/pdf/ICR6050P0664860Box327409B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/428741468046751126/text/ICR6050P0664860Box327409B01PUBLIC1.txt,/projects/documents/2008/05/9684892/kenya-decentralized-reproductive-health-hivaids-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/428741468046751126/Kenya-Decentralized-Reproductive-Health-and-HIV-AIDS-Project,2008/05/9684892/Kenya-Decentralized-Reproductive-Health-and-HIV-AIDS-Project,428741468046751126,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/428741468046751126/Kenya-Decentralized-Reproductive-Health-and-HIV-AIDS-Project,D9684892,43,,,"Health,Sub-National Government",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the measures to alleviate negative environmental impacts are to: Support a systematic assessment of deep groundwater quality in the state. In view of the prohibitive costs of testing for the presence of pesticides and heavy metal contaminants, a phased approach should be adopted which will be based on an initial sampling of deep groundwater and canal waters in all districts of the state. To maintain water quality, opt for advanced treatment options like deflouridation units, iron removal units, Reverse Osmosis units (RO Plant) and other filtration units. Ensure effective and regular disinfection, as well as preventive and corrective maintenance of water distribution systems. Put in place institutional arrangements for preventive and corrective maintenance of water distribution system (leak detection, repair and control) and for preparedness in crisis management during major breakdowns. Develop a protocol for regular water quality testing and control to be implemented through the operations phase of the water supply. Efficient design of surface sullage drains and adoption of good construction practices, along with a system of regular maintenance can ensure that stagnant pools of sullage are eliminated. Installation of small bore sewer systems for conveyance of sewage can eliminate environmental and public health hazards associated with open drain system. Adopting the practice of laying water and sullage lines on different sides of the road reduces the risk of cross contamination. Remodeling existing ponds to accommodate increased sullage flow. Ensure adequate treatment and gainful utilization of the treated effluent/sullage in agriculture, aquaculture and agro forestry. The treatment system could be any of the following: Stabilization Ponds, Duckweed ponds, constructed wetlands etc. Appropriate guidelines and messages need to be included in the communication package being designed for the project, to encourage the villagers to adopt schemes such as sanitary disposal through aquaculture/irrigation. Support a sustained information campaign to create and enhance awareness on hygiene aspects pertaining to handwashing, safe water collection, storage and handling practices. The report also suggests changes to avoid cutting trees, and causing erosion and ensuring soil stabilization. Where it is necessary to do so, replace trees with double the number. All project interventions will be designed to avoid interference with designated forest lands or wetlands. If there are chance finds of objects of cultural/archaeological significance, the relevant agencies will be immediately notified.",,India - Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project : sectoral environmental assessment : Main report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/424991468266450436/pdf/E14350vol-01.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/424991468266450436/text/E14350vol-01.txt,/projects/documents/2006/09/7129740/india-punjab-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project-sectoral-environmental-assessment-main-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/424991468266450436/Main-report,2006/09/7129740/Main-report,424991468266450436,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/424991468266450436/Main-report,D7129740,160,Feedback Turnkey Engineers Pvt.

What do we mean by equity, and how does equity differ from equality Whereas equity is commonly associated positively with impartiality and justice, economists understand equality as an idealistic and unattainable goal often linked to socialism and communism. The terminological twins equity/equality, however, can be conceptualized in highly diverging ways with different consequences for development strategy. The discussions throughout the workshop mirror the controversial positions of international discourse on the topic. Through the varying dimensions of these terms, discussions focused on the different responsibilities for political action such terms entail. For example, whereas equality in outcome implies an egalitarian perspective, economic studies on inequality in outcome mostly take into account the results of actions and conditions such as unequal incomes. Session I, on what is equity, and, what is the role for governments in the promotion of equity, further discussed how does this role differ between developed and developing countries. Nonetheless, it was suggested that before operationalizing and measuring inequity, the concept itself has to be clarified, and, further arguments indicated that one future challenge for development policy is precisely to combine growth-promoting policies with policies that assure that the poor can fully participate in the opportunities that growth offers. Session II, on equity-enhancing social transformation and historical evidence from European and Transition Countries, focus on policies that impact equity. Session III, on building efficient welfare states and lessons learnt, discussed the task of formulating policies that foster both efficiency and equitable social welfare, while Session IV, on international inequalities and what can be done to reduce them, focuses on the global level, contrary to Session III which concentrated on equity issues at the national level. Finally, Session V, on what will greater integration mean for inequalities between and within the richer and poorer countries of the New Europe, draws a very differentiated picture.

Although the project bears similar general lessons from those drawn from countries in economic transition, it illustrates the need for flexibility in design, and during implementation, which could have been achieved through detailed project goals, instead of the very complex project structure. Furthermore, specific lessons suggest that investments in physical infrastructure were at risk of under-utilization, even degradation, with no adequate commitment from operating staff. Initial tests of commitment by staff, and the community should be ensured, prior to allocation of investments, through training participation, and co-financing of works. Furthermore, investment decisions need to be based on stable strategies, agreed for more than just project requirements. In addition, ownership of reform initiatives need to be shared among major stakeholders, through balanced implementation responsibilities between organizations, with both formal, and expert authority, so as not to risk an insufficient technical assistance to the formal authority, which may result in decreased impact of technical recommendations on the decision-making process. Consultation with stakeholders at large, is essential to prevent health management information systems from covering only a small part of the health sector.",,Romania - Health Services Rehabilitation Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/778811468296467332/pdf/multi-page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/778811468296467332/text/multi-page.txt,/projects/documents/2000/06/729050/romania-health-services-rehabilitation-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/778811468296467332/Romania-Health-Services-Rehabilitation-Project,2000/06/729050/Romania-Health-Services-Rehabilitation-Project,778811468296467332,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/778811468296467332/Romania-Health-Services-Rehabilitation-Project,D729050,71,,,"Health,Central Government (Central Agencies)",Europe,,,,,,,,,,Population and Human Resources;center for health promotion;mother and child;primary health care delivery;Internal rate of return;health management information systems;national health insurance fund;universal access to primary;Training of Medical Staff;providers of health care;health sector reform process;health sector reform strategy;Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome;united nations population fund;maternal mortality and morbidity;national health information system;quality at entry;tb control;medical equipment;health sector financing;health promotion activities;management of health;health promotion activity;public health activity;procurement of drugs;health service management;foreign technical assistance;Continuing Medical Education;consortium of university;principal performance ratings;transfer of knowledge;health care system;amount of loan;drug pricing policy;method of procurement;exchange rate;Exchange Rates;procurement and distribution;number of cars;human resource base;emergency medical treatment;production of vaccine;procurement of equipment;Human Immunodeficiency Virus;reallocation of fund;institutional development impact;Emergency Medical Services;health service provider;investments in infrastructure;amount of fund;lack of commitment;health care institutions;blood transfusion centers;supply of contraceptives;local decision making;lack of equipment;vaccine production facility;day care center;children with hiv;Emergency Health Services;remote rural area;delivery of health;health sector development;costs of investment;local health authorities;health policy analysis;source of financing;number of women;health system performance;method of contraception;health sector problems;national health strategies;national health promotion;context of liberalization;quality of product;health financing reform;impact on health;emergency medical care;laboratory equipment;rural health;advanced training;loan fund;continuous education;ambulance system;health reform;reference center;health indicator;district hospital;domestic production;stakeholder workshop;Pharmaceutical Industry;Health policies;Essential Drugs;project costing;physical rehabilitation;educational material;emergency cases;Reproductive Health;managerial capacity;emergency department;procurement process;medical supply;affordable price;emergency need;maternal death;response time;ambulance service;political support;district nursing;general practitioner;Infant Mortality;live birth;production capacity;telecommunications equipment;limited contribution;procurement delay;put pressure;integrated system;vaccine use;policy option;private operator;employee representative;state budget;adequate facility;prime contractor;management function;transition period;partner institution;consulting service;program coordination;emergency management;grant financing;counterpart fund;infrastructure facility;administrative framework;aids program;obstetric risk;international standard;train activity;Consulting services;distinct phase;beneficiary survey;bank finance;staff attitude;private supply;absorption capacity;printing materials;autonomous body;young professional;financial incentive;research capacity;rising trend;long-term training;Project Monitoring;accreditation system;logistical support;treatment capacity;diagnostic equipment;ambulance staff;reform measure;mass immunization;research institution;research institutions;health organization;national immunization;british council;price product;health status;software system;program impact;software procurement;contraceptive supply;university hospital;registration procedure;tax system;transition process;long life;polio vaccine;hepatitis b;adequate housing;Continuing Education;Medical specialties;donor assistance;international procurement;domestic producer;contraceptive prevalence;local unit;pharmaceutical market;emergency procurement;payment system;hospital admission;payment arrangement;provider payment;bureaucratic procedure;teaching staff;sustainable financing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improving the HCWM practices through the implementation of all recommendations in this report remains a difficult exercise in the absence of an integrated solid waste management system for the country.

The AF credit will primarily finance the costs associated with a geographical scale-up of activities under the nutrition component three of the project. Financing will support an additional 837 community nutrition sites in the most food insecure areas of the country. The main objective of the nutrition sites is to deliver a package of direct nutrition services to pregnant and lactating women and children under-five years of age. The AF will also support food security interventions at community and household levels which will be implemented in the same areas as the community nutrition sites supported by the parent project. The AF will scale-up activities in four of the same regions as the food security project as well as two districts in a fifth region severely affected by the on-going locust infestation. Two of these regions are already financed under the parent project so these regions will receive incremental financing to implement the package of food security activities.",,"Madagascar - Additional Financing for the Emergency Support to Critical Education, Health, and Nutrition Services Project",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/669771468271496759/pdf/PAD8980PJPR0P1010Box382145B00OUO090.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/669771468271496759/text/PAD8980PJPR0P1010Box382145B00OUO090.txt,/projects/documents/2014/02/19061520/madagascar-additional-financing-emergency-support-critical-education-health-nutrition-services-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/669771468271496759/Madagascar-Additional-Financing-for-the-Emergency-Support-to-Critical-Education-Health-and-Nutrition-Services-Project,2014/02/19061520/madagascar-additional-financing-emergency-support-critical-education-health-nutrition-services-project,669771468271496759,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/669771468271496759/Madagascar-Additional-Financing-for-the-Emergency-Support-to-Critical-Education-Health-and-Nutrition-Services-Project,D19061520,47,,,"Health,Primary Education,Health,Other social services",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The construction of these bridges will impact on the surface water quality the impact will come from the oil that may leak into the river; the construction under water will cause silts to be suspended, the loss of abandoned construction waste or construction material, construction clay mortar and domestic wastewater near construction site. In operation period, the sewage sources are mainly locomotive depot, wastewater that contains oil discharged from production sections such as vehicle section and domestic wastewater discharged from each station. The main air pollution in construction phase will be from construction dust. After implementation of the project, the existing diesel engine traction locomotives will be replaced by electric traction locomotive. Domestic waste and train waste generated from each station and section will also increase. A new environment impact, electromagnetic pollution will occur. The local land resources will definitely be impacted due to the large amount of land acquisition and removal. Following are some of the mitigation measures: (i) the railway line will be carefully selected to avoid occupying the sensitive ecosystems; (ii) the earthworks will use the excavated earth as backfill where at all possible and minimize the occupation of farmland, cultivated land, and woodlands; (iii) vertical landscaping shall be carried out on the outer sides of the railway stations; (iv) the operation of high-level noise construction shall be 200 meters far from the residential areas, and the low-level noise equipment shall be adopted. Main construction activities shall be strictly controlled within the daytime. Temporary sound-insulation facilities shall be used to decrease the effect of mechanical noise. Construction vehicles shall be arranged to steer clear of the residential areas whenever possible. At the ZheGanLine same time, such vehicles are forbidden to go through the residential areas at night; and (v) watering shall be carried out for temporary roads that have not been laid that are built for the various railway construction site. It shall be done two times per day (one time in morning and another in afternoon) to ease the pollution of dust emissions. The number of watering shall be augmented in dry or blustery contractors Zheanline weather. Covering canvas shall be used for the transportation of cement, sand, lime, and so on.

The Project is expected to have a strongly positive impact on the social conditions faced by the poor in the participating municipalities and pilot rural areas of the Department and is expected to set the stage for a broader and more comprehensive rural intervention which will address the social and economic needs of the large number of rural poor in La Guajira. The main issues raised by the study are the following: (i) the concern over the potential impact of the urban water solution on rural areas (sources of water, disposal of waste water); (ii) the treatment of the urban solution in the cases of Uribia and Manaure, if these municipalities decide to participate in the Project, given that the majority of the population is indigenous population; (iii) political and economic interests created around the current informal market for water; (iv) the cultural dimension and ownership of water among the Wayuu, the original dwellers of La Guajira; and (v) issues of transparency, corruption and social control. In some cases the construction of the works might require purchasing land and the involuntary displacement of the resident population and the economic and social activities located therein. International and national experience has shown that if the impacts caused by involuntary displacement are not mitigated, serious economic and social problems may ensure for the people involved.",,Colombia - La Guajira Water and Sanitation Infrastructure and Services Management Project : resettlement plan : Resettlement policy framework,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/998981468023392986/pdf/RP5070LCR1RI1P096965.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/998981468023392986/text/RP5070LCR1RI1P096965.txt,/projects/documents/2007/01/7347954/colombia-la-guajira-water-sanitation-infrastructure-services-management-project-resettlement-plan-resettlement-policy-framework,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/998981468023392986/Resettlement-policy-framework,2007/01/7347954/Resettlement-policy-framework,998981468023392986,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/998981468023392986/Resettlement-policy-framework,D7347954,21,,,"Sub-National Government,Sewerage,Water Supply",South America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seeks to demonstrate the importance of taking logistics considerations into account when planning for the scale-up of HIV/AIDS programs. The handbook provides practical guidelines for program managers, donors and other partners in planning for the management of commodities to support HIV/AIDS programs. However, the authors assume that the readers are familiar with logistics concepts. The reference section at the back of this manual provides a list of books and articles for those who would like to get general information on logistics and drug supply management. The handbook does not provide a rigid, one-size-fits-all template for supply chain Management, but does explore some of the lessons learned in the past few years of HIV logistics in order to provide general principles for management of HIV/AIDS medical commodities.",,National HIV/AIDS programs : a handbook on supply chain management for HIV/AIDS medical commodities,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/413721468316131387/pdf/372160ENGLISH01SupplyChain01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/413721468316131387/text/372160ENGLISH01SupplyChain01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2004/11/7040576/national-hivaids-programs-handbook-supply-chain-management-hivaids-medical-commodities,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/413721468316131387/National-HIV-AIDS-programs-a-handbook-on-supply-chain-management-for-HIV-AIDS-medical-commodities,2004/11/7040576/National-HIV-AIDS-programs-a-handbook-on-supply-chain-management-for-HIV-AIDS-medical-commodities,413721468316131387,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/413721468316131387/National-HIV-AIDS-programs-a-handbook-on-supply-chain-management-for-HIV-AIDS-medical-commodities,D7040576,69,"Raja, Sangeeta","Mohammad, Nadeem",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A secondary but important global objective would be the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through reduced gas flaring and enhanced share of cleaner generation. Some of the negative impacts of the project are: 1) loss or fragmentation of natural habitat, leading to reduction in biodiversity and possible impacts on rare or endangered specie; 2) disturbance by noise and vibration in surrounding communities; 3) alteration of surface drainage pattern leading to erosion; 4) exposure of workers and nearby communities to excessive noise from the power plant; 5) disposal of packaging materials thereby leading to soil/water pollution; and 6) spills and leaks have contaminated soil, structures, and possibly groundwater. Mitigation measures of the project are: 1) maintain equipment and facilities at optimal operating conditions as stated in the equipment operating manual, equipment with low noise rating shall be used, install noise barriers around high noise areas in the facility, periodically monitor noise levels and adhere to prescribed limits in the workplace, at the plant boundary, and in surrounding communities provide ear muffs and enforce their use enforced in high noise areas on site; 2) ensure that the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant and oil separators are optimized so that effluents meet regulatory limits before discharge; 3) ensure that solid wastes are categorized and containerized to prevent contact with soil and groundwater before being transported to disposal site; and 4) clean up and remove any wastes or contaminated soils, and maintain liaison with communities and local government on final disposition of site.",,Nigeria - Electricity and Gas Improvement Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 8) : Environmental and social managment plan of Birrin Kebbi sub-station,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/299671468288333050/pdf/E20010v80EA0P10P0P106172BirrenKebbi.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/299671468288333050/text/E20010v80EA0P10P0P106172BirrenKebbi.txt,/projects/documents/2009/08/16336337/nigeria-electricity-gas-improvement-project-environmental-assessment-vol-8-environmental-social-managment-plan-birrin-kebbi-sub-station,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/299671468288333050/Environmental-and-social-managment-plan-of-Birrin-Kebbi-sub-station,2009/08/16336337/nigeria-electricity-gas-improvement-project-environmental-assessment-vol-8-9-environmental-social-managment-plan-birrin-kebbi-sub-station,299671468288333050,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/299671468288333050/Environmental-and-social-managment-plan-of-Birrin-Kebbi-sub-station,D16336337,51,,,Power,West Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, following a critical analysis on the baseline environmental status, the EA recommends mitigation measures as follows. Water quantity of existing water supplies should be augmented through the rehabilitation of existing systems; identification of new sources (mostly ground water sources); local, and distant surface sources, requiring simple treatment, such as slow sand filtration, and/or chlorination; and, appropriate blending of water from existing sources to meet drinking water quality standards. Water quality should undergo a sanitary survey, to then include measures to convert existing dug wells into sanitary wells, and fence surface sources, to obtain a catchment area protection. Continuous chlorination should be implemented, including regular water quality testing, and bacteriological control. Adequate residual pressure should be ensured at the distribution points, and household, community, and institutional latrines promoted. Sustained sanitation/hygiene programs would increase positive attitudes, and behavior, specially focused on women, and children. In addition, drainage should include treatment, and disposal of residues, while a solid waste management program should identify common sites for sanitary disposal, and, waste could be composted, to be sold as fertilizer to generate income. Health preventive issues include curative programs, and regular de-worming measures.",,India - Second Karnataka Rural Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 2) : Final report (revised),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/512141468050652870/pdf/multi0page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/512141468050652870/text/multi0page.txt,/projects/documents/2001/08/1552014/india-second-karnataka-rural-water-supply-environmental-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-final-report-revised,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/512141468050652870/Final-report-revised,2001/08/1552014/india-second-karnataka-rural-water-supply-environmental-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-2-final-report-revised,512141468050652870,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/512141468050652870/Final-report-revised,D1552014,318,"Paramasivam, R.

Thailand has received international recognition for its successful interventions to reduce the transmission of HIV among female sex workers and military recruits. It is looked upon as a role model for HIV education and awareness campaigns that include the extensive promotion and wide acceptance of condoms as an HIV prevention strategy. Thailand has the most progressive and comprehensive antiretroviral program in the region with a reported coverage of over 80 percent of eligible individuals. In 2001, it embarked on a progressive universal health care program that provides free access to a wide array of health care diagnostics and therapeutics for the people of Thailand. With these impressive achievements, it is remarkable how poorly Thailand has responded to the HIV epidemic among injection drug users (IDUs). From available data, it appears that the HIV prevalence rates among IDUs have remained high and stagnant over the last decade. Failure to provide effective interventions to reduce HIV transmission among drug users has resulted in unnecessary suffering, and for many, HIV-related death. Continued inaction threatens to undermine successful HIV prevention efforts in the country through ongoing HIV transmission among injection drug users and their sexual partners. The current focus on enforcement and punishment, along with the reliance on compulsory drug treatment centers, has done little to control drug use in Thailand. The unintended consequence of this approach has been to push drug users into precarious and dangerous environments that have directly led to risky drug using patterns and persistently high rates of HIV transmission. Adopting a harm reduction approach to deal with injection drug use could have a major impact on reducing HIV transmission as well as engaging drug users into better health care and effective drug treatment. This will require strong leadership in key government Ministries and related agencies so that the central stakeholders can roll out harm reduction programs. Thailand has the potential to greatly reduce the transmission of HIV among injection drug users and become a regional leader in harm reduction.",,Harm reduction policies and interventions for injection drug users in Thailand,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/678211468310529526/pdf/64642-P122427-REVISED.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/678211468310529526/text/64642-P122427-REVISED.txt,/research/2011/08/15444886/harm-reduction-policies-interventions-injection-drug-users-thailand,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/678211468310529526/Harm-reduction-policies-and-interventions-for-injection-drug-users-in-Thailand,2011/08/15444886/harm-reduction-policies-interventions-injection-drug-users-thailand,678211468310529526,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/678211468310529526/Harm-reduction-policies-and-interventions-for-injection-drug-users-in-Thailand,D15444886,50,,,Health,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report includes updates of the 2008 environment management plan as part of preparation for the second additional financing to reflect the lessons learned during safeguards implementation of the oroginal project development objective and the first additional financing. The second additional financing will not finance civil works and concerns four project components: component A will strengthen health service delivery; component B will improve health financing; component C will strengthen human resources; and component D will strengthen health system stewardship functions. No additional funding is available for components C and D. Continued financing of health equity funds and service delivery grants is consistent with the program's development objective. As with the original project and the first additional financing, the second additional financing is expected to have a positive impact on the lives of peoples throughout Cambodia, particularly the poorest, by improving their access to and utilization of effective and efficient health services. The second additional financing will not affect any natural habitats, forests, or cultural resources.

Long term improvements in education and employment opportunities for women will have a positive impact on the health of women and their families. In the short term, significant progress can be achieved by strengthening and expanding essential health services for women, improving policies, and promoting more positive attitudes and behavior towards women's health. In the design and implementation of programs, constraints to women's acess to care need to be taken into account. Outreach, mobile clinics and community-based services can be helpful. Women should be empowered to make more informed decisions and to act on them. Quality of care is a significant factor in women's decision to seek care. Effective client-provider interaction is increasingly recognized as a key factor for improving quality of services. In addition to strengthening services, through legislation, legal enforcement, and information, education, and communication, harmful practices such as gender discrimination, domestic violence, and female genital mutilation can be curbed. Close collaboration among government, non-governmental organizations, communities, and women's groups will make service more responsive to women and improve utilization and impact.",HNP discussion paper series,Improving women's health : issues and interventions,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/355541468762361606/text/multi-page.txt,/research/2000/06/693031/improving-womens-health-issues-interventions,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/355541468762361606/Improving-womens-health-issues-and-interventions,2000/06/693031/improving-womens-health-issues-interventions,355541468762361606,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/355541468762361606/Improving-womens-health-issues-and-interventions,D693031,null,"Tinker, Anne","Finn, Kathleen","Primary Health, Including Reproductive Health, Chi",,,"Epp, Joanne",,,,,,,,"elimination of violence against woman;women's health;women in developing countries;access to reproductive health;life expectancy at birth;Information, Education and Communication;commercial sex worker;maternal and child health;access to health service;united nations population fund;health status of women;quality of health services;cost of service delivery;primary health care system;nutritional status of women;male health care providers;Reproductive and Child Health;population and reproductive health;access to health care;promotion of condom use;Voluntary Testing and Counseling;Democratic Republic of Congo;cancer of the cervix;sexual abuse during childhood;female genital mutilation;maternal mortality ratio;Sexually Transmitted Infection;traditional birth attendant;risk complication;health of woman;reducing maternal mortality;access to microfinance;human rights issue;reproductive health service;maternal health service;safe motherhood interventions;access to information;quality of care;high fertility rate;dependence on men;burden of disease;vitamin a deficiency;Complications of Pregnancy;essential health services;maternal health care;family planning counseling;emergency obstetric care;number of girls;traditional gender roles;HIV and AIDS;improvements in health;iron deficiency anemia;loss of life;reproductive health activity;bank's assistance programs;demand for service;skilled health provider;basic training;alternative employment opportunity;maternal health indicator;reproductive health survey;opportunity for woman;basic family planning;act of violence;types of violence;income earning activity;comprehensive reproductive health;risk of disease;reproductive health program;consequences of disease;entire life cycle;income generating opportunity;women at risk;reproductive tract infection;young adult women;Human Immunodeficiency Virus;grass root level;survival of infants;basic maternity care;stage of disease;births per woman;total fertility rate;urinary tract infection;poor health status;severe malnutrition;education of girl;human development indicator;access to care;termination of pregnancy;world war i;aids campaign;susceptibility to infection;adult male mortality;public awareness campaign;reproductive health policy;level of policy;basic human right;transmission of hiv;health and nutrition;continuum of care;poor maternal health;drugs and supplies;female health workers;reproductive health problems;pregnant woman;public education;government commitment;cost-effective intervention;non-governmental organization;employment opportunities;unwanted pregnancy;district hospital;unwanted fertility;sex industry;referral system;reproductive age;maternal death;village midwife;cultural factor;cultural reasons;obstetrics emergency;sexual relationship;communication programs;social status;cumulative effect;health community;energy loss;Sexual Assault;donor investment;remote area;midwifery skills;Medical care;safe sex;disproportionate share;premature death;skilled staff;behavior change;chronic disease;significant factor;Sexual Violence;aid control;safe delivery;Antenatal Care;client-provider interaction;traditional practitioners;health outcome;mental depression;high-risk group;essential services;micronutrient supplements;disease burden;unsafe sex;positive impact;health gain;family resource;females age;reproductive year;weight gain;adult woman;health interventions;preventing infection;national-level population;psychosocial support;civil society;prevalence rate;reproductive biology;preventable mortality;youth group;health agenda;socioeconomic status;emergency contraception;gynecological cancers;present value;biological factor;sexual exposure;obstetric fistula;obstetrics fistula;aging population;severe consequence;viral hepatitis;Cardiovascular Disease;human papillomavirus;health benefit;mobile clinic;case management;local ngo;gender dimension;food supply;refugee camp;rough terrain;economic crisis;maternity waiting;physical protection;grant funds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some lessons learned included: for project supported civil work, it is essential to obtain land clearance of the construction site before the project starts. The project provided a good lesson on why it is important to have a well prepared construction site before approval. It required a lot of efforts to get through Government procedures to deal with land clearance and authorization. Bank policy on social safeguards should be strictly followed during project preparation and implementation. The project provided a very good example of the close relationship with and support to the implementation of the national program. The project activities were designed very much in line with the Government priorities so that project outcomes directly contributed to the improvement of the Government system. Especially in a country as dynamic as Vietnam, it was important to adopt a flexible approach to the project to be able to respond to the important needs of the client when needed and where they were consistent with the key development objective of the project. Project design should be less complex to facilitate implementation. Flexible and in time solutions to tackle emergent issues and difficulties during the implementation are essential to make the project move.",,Vietnam - Regional Blood Transfusion Centers Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/981391468125072846/pdf/ICR13580P073301C0disclosed041151101.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/981391468125072846/text/ICR13580P073301C0disclosed041151101.txt,/projects/documents/2010/03/12112882/vietnam-regional-blood-transfusion-centers-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/981391468125072846/Vietnam-Regional-Blood-Transfusion-Centers-Project,2010/03/12112882/vietnam-regional-blood-transfusion-centers-project,981391468125072846,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/981391468125072846/Vietnam-Regional-Blood-Transfusion-Centers-Project,D12112882,51,,,Health,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Project will (a) scale-up the involvement of the private sector in medium-sized cities, through the introduction of performance-based management arrangements with specialized operators; (b) support service-improvement related investment through targeted capital grants in small- and medium-size cities, and in some high poverty peri-urban areas of large cities, served by public utilities; and, (c) deliver appropriate water supply and sanitation investments to Colombia's underserved rural areas. Consistent with the scope and objectives, the Project will have two components: Component 1 - Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Infrastructure, to finance investments in the rehabilitation and construction/expansion of primary and secondary water and sewerage networks; investments in water treatment plants, pumping stations and main collectors, wastewater treatment infrastructure including treatment plants and discharge infrastructure; and, construction and implementation supervision at the municipal level through independent supervision consultants. The Component will finance two types of subprojects: a) infrastructure investment subprojects, to be accompanied by technical assistance for utility reform; and, (b) modernization subprojects, which would involve financing of both investment, and the introduction of private sector management for local utilities. Component 2 - Program Management, Benchmarking, Monitoring and Evaluation, to finance consultant services and equipment to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of environment, Housing and Regional Development (MAVDT) to implement the Project at the central level, and provide technical assistance to the participating municipal utilities. Activities to be financed under this Component include: supply and installation of information technology equipment to allow for an efficient monitoring of utility performance, and program implementation; technical assistance and training to the MAVDT, for Project implementation, monitoring and financial management; and, other operating expenses for the MAVDT, and in particular, The Directorate of Potable Water and Basic Sanitation (DAPSBA).",,Colombia - Water and Sanitation Sector Support Project,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/609601468746698341/text/29601.txt,/projects/documents/2005/02/5622752/colombia-water-sanitation-sector-support-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/609601468746698341/Colombia-Water-and-Sanitation-Sector-Support-Project,2005/02/5622752/colombia-water-sanitation-sector-support-project,609601468746698341,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/609601468746698341/Colombia-Water-and-Sanitation-Sector-Support-Project,D5622752,null,,,General finance sector,Latin America & Caribbean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because good health increases the economic productivity of individuals and the economic growth rate of countries, investing in health is one means of accelerating development. More important, good health is a goal in itself. During the past forty years life expectancy in the developing world has risen and child mortality has decreased, sometimes dramatically. But progress is only one side of the picture. The toll from childhood and tropical diseases remains high even as new problems - including AIDS and the diseases of aging populations - appear on the scene. And all countries are struggling with the problems of controlling health expenditures and making health care accessible to the broad population. This report examines the controversial questions surrounding health care and health policy. Its findings are based in large part on innovative research, including estimation of the global burden of disease and the cost-effectiveness of interventions. These assessments can help in setting priorities for health spending. The report advocates a threefold approach to health policy for governments in developing countries and in the formerly socialist countries. First, to foster an economic environment that will enable households to improve their own health. Policies for economic growth that ensure income gains for the poor are essential. So, too, is expanded investment in schooling, particulary for girls. Second, redirect government spending away from specialized care and toward such low-cost and highly effective activities such as immunization, programs to combat micronutrient deficiencies, and control and treatment of infectious diseases. By adopting the packages of public health measures and essential clinical care dsecribed in the report, developing countries could reduce their burden of disease by 25 percent. Third, encourage greater diversity and competition in the provision of health services by decentralizing government services, promoting competitive procurement practices, fostering greater involvement by nongovernmental and other private organizations, and regulating insurance markets. These reforms could translate into longer, healthier, and more productive lives for people around the world, and especially for the more than 1 billion poor. As in previous editions, this report includes the World Development Indicators, which give comprehensive, current data on social and economic development in more than 200 countries and territories.","World Development Indicators,World development report",World development report 1993 : investing in health,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/468831468340807129/pdf/121830REPLACEMENT0WDR01993.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/468831468340807129/text/121830REPLACEMENT0WDR01993.txt,/research/1993/06/17390669/world-development-report-1993-investing-health,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/468831468340807129/World-development-report-1993-investing-in-health,1993/06/17390669/World-development-report-1993-investing-in-health,468831468340807129,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/468831468340807129/World-development-report-1993-investing-in-health,D17390669,348,"Berkley, Seth","Bobadilla,Jose Luis","(Historic)Primary health, including reproductive health, child health and health,(Historic)Non-sector specific",,,"Hecht,Robert M.","Hill, Kenneth","Jamison,Dean T.","Murray, Christopher J.

The project comprises of five components. The first component, enrollment and empanelment of the population into UHIS will focus on carrying out an annual program of activities to support the enrollment of the target population (including the vulnerable groups who are eligible for premium subsidies as per the UHIL) in first phase governorates into the UHIS as well as the empanelment of enrollees with general practitioners (GPs). The second component, strengthening UHIS governance, systems, and facilitating environment will focus on carrying out an annual program of activities to: (a) strengthen UHIS governance and institutional arrangements, including the UHIS oversight and coordination platform; (b) create an enabling environment for private sector participation and citizen engagement mechanisms at both the central and governorate levels through the establishment of coordination bodies for UHIS at the national level and in all first phase governorates; and (c) support UHIS positive environmental, climate, and social outcomes.

Lessons learned included: 1) The availability of medication in or near PHC facilities and the provision of basic laboratory equipment significantly increase patient utilization of PHC services, especially among women and children, and improve patient satisfaction with respect to access and quality of care; 2) Training of specialist physicians in topics related to PHC and clinical facilitation improves the knowledge of trainees; 3) While project evaluation demonstrated in an unambiguous way the positive effects of training on the improvement of medical knowledge, it was less clear regarding the effect of training on the use of new knowledge in clinical practice; 4) Rationalization plans related to physical infrastructure and health personnel need concrete project resources, activities and some type of conditionality in order to be implemented; 5) High-level involvement from the government side is a necessary ingredient for successful project implementation. Government ownership not only leads to better implemented projects but also and perhaps more importantly, increases the probability of continuing with the reform efforts after the completion of the project; 6) Flexibility and prompt reaction from the Bank side during project supervision facilitates successful project implementation and ensures appropriate post-completion arrangements and follow-up operations; 7) The development of a comprehensive M&E system in project design assists in demonstrating the connection between project activities and outcomes and provides valuable input for follow-up operations; and 8) Reaching out to a broad range of stakeholders prevents the derailing of the health reform process.",,Azerbaijan - Health Reform Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/708981468220522872/pdf/ICR0000318.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/708981468220522872/text/ICR0000318.txt,/projects/documents/2007/03/7572127/azerbaijan-health-reform-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/708981468220522872/Azerbaijan-Health-Reform-Project,2007/03/7572127/Azerbaijan-Health-Reform-Project,708981468220522872,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/708981468220522872/Azerbaijan-Health-Reform-Project,D7572127,70,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Health,Compulsory health finance",Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,Eastern Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A secondary but important global objective would be the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through reduced gas flaring and enhanced share of cleaner generation. Some of the negative impacts of the project are: 1) loss or fragmentation of natural habitat, leading to reduction in biodiversity and possible impacts on rare or endangered specie; 2) disturbance by noise and vibration in surrounding communities; 3) alteration of surface drainage pattern leading to erosion; 4) exposure of workers and nearby communities to excessive noise from the power plant; 5) disposal of packaging materials thereby leading to soil/water pollution; and 6) spills and leaks have contaminated soil, structures, and possibly groundwater. Mitigation measures of the project are: 1) maintain equipment and facilities at optimal operating conditions as stated in the equipment operating manual, equipment with low noise rating shall be used, install noise barriers around high noise areas in the facility, periodically monitor noise levels and adhere to prescribed limits in the workplace, at the plant boundary, and in surrounding communities provide ear muffs and enforce their use enforced in high noise areas on site; 2) ensure that the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant and oil separators are optimized so that effluents meet regulatory limits before discharge; 3) ensure that solid wastes are categorized and containerized to prevent contact with soil and groundwater before being transported to disposal site; and 4) clean up and remove any wastes or contaminated soils, and maintain liaison with communities and local government on final disposition of site.",,Nigeria - Electricity and Gas Improvement Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 7) : Environmental and social management plan for PHCN-TCN transmission substation rehabilitation/re-enforcement projects under the NEGIP (Ayede 330/132/33KV transmission s/station),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/324201468290406749/pdf/E20010v70EA0P10R0ESMP0P106172AIYEDE.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/324201468290406749/text/E20010v70EA0P10R0ESMP0P106172AIYEDE.txt,/projects/documents/2009/08/16336340/nigeria-electricity-gas-improvement-project-environmental-assessment-vol-7-environmental-social-management-plan-phcn-tcn-transmission-substation-rehabilitationre-enforcement-projects-under-negip-ayede-33013233kv-transmission-sstation,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/324201468290406749/Environmental-and-social-management-plan-for-PHCN-TCN-transmission-substation-rehabilitation-re-enforcement-projects-under-the-NEGIP-Ayede-330-132-33KV-transmission-s-station,2009/08/16336340/nigeria-electricity-gas-improvement-project-environmental-assessment-vol-7-9-environmental-social-management-plan-phcn-tcn-transmission-substation-rehabilitationre-enforcement-projects-under-negip-ayede-33013233kv-transmission-sstation,324201468290406749,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/324201468290406749/Environmental-and-social-management-plan-for-PHCN-TCN-transmission-substation-rehabilitation-re-enforcement-projects-under-the-NEGIP-Ayede-330-132-33KV-transmission-s-station,D16336340,50,,,Power,West Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the fundamental role of pharmaceuticals, there remains a profound gap between the benefit which pharmaceuticals have to offer and the reality that for millions of people -- particularly poor and disadvantaged people -- medicines are unavailable, unaffordable, unsafe or improperly used. This World Bank Pharmaceuticals Discussion Paper provides a pragmatic analysis of some of the causes for this gap and strategic directions to help close this gap. The strategic directions outlined in this Pharmaceuticals Discussion Paper complement and reinforce the objectives outlined in the WHO Medicines Strategy: 2000-2003 (World Health Organization, Geneva, 2000, WHO/EDM/2000.1). The WHO strategy describes specific objectives, expected outcomes, and progress indicators in the areas of drug policy, access to essential drugs, quality and safety, and rational use of medicines. Both the World Bank and the WHO initiatives rest on a fundamental commitment to work with governments, on governmental organizations, the private sector, professional bodies, and other key actors to help strengthen the pharmaceutical sector and its ability to contribute to improved health outcomes.. The current burden of disease falling on the two billion people living on less than one dollar per day undermines both individual well-being and collective economic development. Much of this burden of disease can be reduced by securing the availability, affordability, and rational use of essential drugs of assured quality. Yet this aim can not be achieved by governments alone, by individual multilateral organizations working alone, or by any other individual organization. It can only be achieved when committed governments and local organizations are supported by clear, consistency, and mutually compatible approaches by agencies such as the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, others in the UN family, bilateral donors, and the broader development community. This discussion paper provides an important contribution to this process.",HNP discussion paper series,World Bank pharmaceuticals,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/757701468764990351/text/288760Govindar1Pharmacuetical1whole.txt,/research/2000/09/3928594/world-bank-pharmaceuticals,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/757701468764990351/World-Bank-pharmaceuticals,2000/09/3928594/world-bank-pharmaceuticals,757701468764990351,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/757701468764990351/World-Bank-pharmaceuticals,D3928594,null,"Govindaraj, Ramesh","Reich, Michael R.",,,,"Cohen, Jillian C.",,,,,,,,access to essential drug;learning and innovation loan;Rational Use of Medicines;adaptable program loan;protection of intellectual property;Rational Use of Drugs;political economy of health;health care delivery system;pharmaceutical policy;pharmaceutical sector;pharmaceutical procurement;access to drugs;national drug policy;public health budget;control of corruption;procurement and distribution;public sector procurement;burden of disease;primary health care;quality assurance system;purchase of goods;contribution to welfare;procurement pharmaceutical;community of practice;exchange of knowledge;social and environmental;expected present value;overseas development assistance;introducing new products;foreign direct investment;health care expenditure;procurement of drugs;health system performance;quality assurance standard;health policy objectives;essential drugs list;private sector resource;impact on health;social marketing program;supervision of bank;provision of good;pharmaceutical regulatory agencies;local capacity building;pharmaceutical supply chain;health care system;knowledge management system;role in society;health care policy;Health care policies;private sector institutions;Pharmaceutical Industry;drug procurement;regulatory capacity;pharmaceutical reform;health reform;pharmaceutical expenditure;pharmaceutical market;development partner;product patent;market failure;drug supply;drug therapy;political analysis;lending activities;patent protection;compulsory licensing;pharmaceutical company;drug financing;essential medicines;drug selection;poverty alleviation;systematic evaluation;public-private partnership;comparative analysis;health needs;international agency;private expenditure;reform effort;tiered pricing;tropical disease;international market;global market;drug regulatory;government failure;public policy;policy option;cumulative value;human capital;reduced poverty;lending practice;structural adjustment;pharmaceutical spending;reform process;medical equipment;learning mode;donor coordination;short term consultant;drug legislation;pricing policy;project lending;sectoral reform;poverty focus;political context;drug price;previous draft;financial resource;pharmaceutical financing;hepatitis b;important policy;household income;effective supervision;rising cost;priority program;Tobacco Control;primary audience;external source;medical supply;disproportionate share;Performance Standards;consumption comparisons;unique identifier;product testing;direct oversight;procurement definition;objective assessment;Institutional Sustainability;alternative strategy;global fund;market uncertainty;management science;existing resources;increased accountability;corruption issues;vaccine market;Learning and Innovation Credit;drug registration;interest group;private investment;effective regulatory;competition framework;strategic partnerships;budgetary restraint;drug quality;intended beneficiary;policy process;adequate consideration;formal policy;pharmaceutical pricing;drug list;global experience;empirical analysis;international drug;health benefit;cultural dimension;enterprise institute;oecd countries;management capacity;widespread corruption;registration requirement;market concentration;poor community;partner institution;household spending;sector activity;social function;pharmaceutical marketing;health systems;price competition;multinational companies;multinational company;price comparison;market size;price range;market environment;Health Workers;globalized economy;disadvantaged people;government effort;bureaucratic problems;drug industry;price regulation;price control;capacity utilization;storage system;regulatory requirement;Industrial Policy;manufacturing process;Counterfeit Drugs;important component;private market;private actor;care provision;distribution facility;pharmaceutical warehousing;Industrial Policies;risk pool;investment loan;upper bind;cost categories;international donor;imported drugs;domestic industry;civil works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These industry sector EHS guidelines are designed to be used together with the General EHS Guidelines document, which provides guidance to users on common EHS issues potentially applicable to all industry sectors. For complex projects, use of multiple industry-sector guidelines may be necessary. The EHS guidelines for Health Care Facilities include information relevant to the management of EHS issues associated with health care facilities (HCF) which includes a diverse range of facilities and activities involving general hospitals and small inpatient primary care hospitals, as well as outpatient, assisted living, and hospice facilities.

Several factors make this exercise particularly timely: 1) the concern that the economic downturn of the early 1980s may have adversely affected the health sector in Africa; 2) the need to evaluate the impact of primary health care strategies, especially the key elements of immunization and oral rehydration; 3) the completion of a substantial body of epidemiological and demographic analyses, which provides a much improved empirical basis for assessing health conditions and recent health trends; 4) the concern that the global emergence of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and its sharp impact in selected African foci have undermined development prospects in some countries; and 5) the potential value of explicitly seeking lessons from the Bank's experience with health sector operations in Africa.

During the entire period, the rural health Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) team analyzed the sector and debated reform options with government officials and scholars. It is helped the government in its extensive reform efforts over the past few years. The publication can serve two important functions: to provide an analytical framework for thinking about what happened in China's rural health system and why, and to present a global perspective on the options for further strengthening the sector. China is well on its way to achieving a modern, equitable, and well-functioning rural health sector, but this is not an easy task for any country.

and Sanitation Project for Kyrgyz Republic are as follows: outcomes of the project were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: views and inputs should be collected prior to subproject selection and design, community-based organizations should be formed and mobilized, intensive awareness campaigns should be carried out on subproject selection criteria and post-implementation requirements, in addition, subproject design should be compatible with community management capacity to maintain and operate the system. The Community Drinking Water Users Union (CDWUU) had to rent equipment, which in many cases was unaffordable, most communities are willing to procure equipment on installments and asked the project to help create a revolving fund so groups of closely located CDWUU could buy equipment and repay the cost in installments. A community-based approach works well when people understand why they should come together to address common problems and why they pay and what they for. It took some time for the project to make people understand that they were not paying for water but for the services to bring water, clean it and make it safe. Likewise, in a community based approach, when the people feel ownership of the system, they care more about the investments they have made.",,Kyrgyz Republic - Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311211468302429522/pdf/ICR10840P036971C0Disclosed051291091.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311211468302429522/text/ICR10840P036971C0Disclosed051291091.txt,/projects/documents/2009/05/10622259/kyrgyz-republic-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311211468302429522/Kyrgyz-Republic-Rural-Water-Supply-and-Sanitation-Project,2009/05/10622259/kyrgyz-republic-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project,311211468302429522,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311211468302429522/Kyrgyz-Republic-Rural-Water-Supply-and-Sanitation-Project,D10622259,62,,,Water Supply,Asia,,,,,,,,,,,Central Asia,Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Life expectancy in developing countries increased from forty to sixty-three years between 1950 and 1990 with a concommitant rise in the incidence of noncommunicable diseases of adults and the elderly. It is still necessary to deal with under nutrition and communicable childhood diseases. Also, new epidemic diseases like AIDS are emerging, and the health of the poor during economic crisis is a growing concern. These health developments intensify the need for better information on the effectiveness and cost of health interventions. The information is intended for health practitioners at every level. Individual chapters offer preventive and case management guidelines critical to improving the quality of care. The need for health sector reform is global. Both developed and developing countries, and centrally planned and market oriented health systems share basic dissatisfaction with the present organization and financing of health care delivery and a conviction that there are better ways to obtain results with the available resources. This book attempts to assist health sector reformers to review existing services and adapt them to provide the most cost effective interventions available.",Disease Control Priorities,Disease control priorities in developing countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/705591468320064221/pdf/multi0page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/705591468320064221/text/multi0page.txt,/research/1993/10/698818/disease-control-priorities-developing-countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/705591468320064221/Disease-control-priorities-in-developing-countries,1993/10/698818/Disease-control-priorities-in-developing-countries,705591468320064221,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/705591468320064221/Disease-control-priorities-in-developing-countries,D698818,776,"Jamison, Dean T.

Reuse of treated sewage to fertilize the microbial food chain for aquaculture presents one of the most economic resource recovery options for cities in developing countries. With that in mind, this study examines wastewater-based fish and prawn culture research development and demonstration efforts conducted in Lima, Peru. In this study, fish and prawns were cultured in wastewater stabilization lagoons operating as polishing lagoons in series with primary and secondary ponds. It was found that the environmental conditions in the ponds were satisfactory for the survival and growth of tilapia and carps, particularly in the cycle-end polishing ponds. However, more research regarding this topic (i.e. a demonstration project) will follow to clarify missing parameters from this research and to elaborate on the health and economic aspects of this study.",Applied Research and Technology (WUDAT) technical note ; no. 3 -- Integrated Resource Recovery Project,"Aquaculture with treated wastewater : a status report on studies conducted in Lima, Peru",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/926381468294119119/pdf/TEC3000Aquacul0ducted0in0Lima00Peru.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/926381468294119119/text/TEC3000Aquacul0ducted0in0Lima00Peru.txt,/research/1987/01/1554636/aquaculture-treated-wastewater-status-report-studies-conducted-lima-peru,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/926381468294119119/Aquaculture-with-treated-wastewater-a-status-report-on-studies-conducted-in-Lima-Peru,1987/01/1554636/aquaculture-treated-wastewater-status-report-studies-conducted-lima-peru,926381468294119119,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/926381468294119119/Aquaculture-with-treated-wastewater-a-status-report-on-studies-conducted-in-Lima-Peru,D1554636,69,"Johnson Cointreau, Sandra",,Fisheries,Latin America & Caribbean,,,,,,,,,,Aquaculture; Sewage; Fish; Prawns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has set two overarching and strategic goals: (a) To reduce the incidence of HIV infections; and to mitigate the negative impact of HIV/AIDS on persons infected and affected i(PLWA).. The activities are grouped into 5 components, similar to the 5 priority areas contemplated in the Five-Year National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2003-2007). These components would apply to Trinidad, Tobago or both: Component 1 helps prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS by promoting behavioral change. It intensifies education and heightens awareness, targets high-risk groups, and improves the availability and accessibility of condoms. This component also supports interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission, supports a national voluntary testing and counseling (VCT) program, which includes the establishment of private VCT sites; provides diagnosis, treatment, and counseling for sexually transmitted diseases; improves biomedical waste management; and finances technical assistance for blood bank and transfusion services. Component 2 finances the installation capacity for HIV testing in selected health centers, as well as in all Enhanced Health Centers and District Health Centers (DHC); finances the construction of new buildings ; purchases equipment; trains medical staff and lab staff in diagnosiing HIV/AIDS and opportunistic infections; upgrades pharmacy service infrastructures; trains pharmacy staff and funds training manuals for home care. Component 3 supports drafting legislation in relation to discrimination against PLWA in the workplace. Consultants will review the legislation and make recommendations as to the amendments of such legislation and/or propose legislation which may be needed. The project will also finance nongovernmental organization services for planning and implementing positive advocacy campaigns. Component 4 supports the implementation of standardized protocols for behavioral (""second generation"") and biological surveillance. It also provides technical assistance required for the selection, acquisition, adaptation and implementation of clinical information systems; sexual risk; behavior surveys; HIV/AIDS surveillance training; information technology training; LAN installation, hubs, UPS, communications; servers, work stations and operational software; scanners and printers; broad band installation & annual service; research proposed by national and regional agencies.

For the year 2002, the following benchmarks are established: (1) reduce by 25 percent infant mortality attributable to malaria; (2) reduce by 90 percent school-age children morbidity attributable to urinary schistosomiasis; and (3) eliminate the risk of blindness due to onchocerciasis. To achieve these objectives, the project will support policy measures designed to: (1) improve management and implementation of disease control activities; (2) develop an integrated and computerized health management information system (SIG) and its use; and (3) strengthen the National Endemic Disease Service's (SNGE) capabilities and the Hygiene and Public Health Directorate's (DHSP) ability in project management. Specifically, project support will take the form of financing consultant services to design and produce information campaigns and national control programs, and studies and operational research; the education of opinionmakers and householders; using preventative measures and dispensing pharmaceuticals to treat schoolchildren; training nurses and the national endemic disease service staff; the procurement of computer hardware and software, furniture and other equipment; and the design and supervision of civil works.","World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2",Senegal - Endemic Disease Control Project,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/537551468777943296/text/multi0page.txt,/projects/documents/1997/04/694866/senegal-endemic-disease-control-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/537551468777943296/Senegal-Endemic-Disease-Control-Project,1997/04/694866/senegal-endemic-disease-control-project,537551468777943296,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/537551468777943296/Senegal-Endemic-Disease-Control-Project,D694866,null,,,"Health,Central Government (Central Agencies)",Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,Blindness; Computers; Disease control; Disease prevention; Endemic diseases; Health care delivery; Health policy; Households; Hygiene; Infant mortality; Information dissemination; Information systems; Insecticides; Malaria; Molluscicides; Morbidity; Onchocerciasis; Pharmaceuticals; Schistosomiasis; Training,Sahel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study finds that there are sharp differences in health outcomes and in underlying epidemiological conditions within the country sample. One group - comprising Vanuatu, Kiribati, Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands - is characterized by moderately high infant mortality, relatively low life expectancy and high fertility. In these countries, populations are still susceptible, despite some advances, to many infectious and parasitic diseases and reproductive-related health problems commonly associated with poverty. By contrast, child survival prospects and overall life expectancy are higher in the second country cluster - Western Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji. This improved health outlook is descernible in the much larger share of deaths attributable to cardiovascular ailments, neoplasms and injuries, all of which typically affect mature adults. Low recorded infant mortality rates (IMRs) correspond to declining incidence of undernutrition, infectious diseases and deaths from perinatal causes, thanks in part to effective immunization efforts, and extensive coverage of piped water systems. But these countries now face rising prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases and various non-communicable diseases and health problems linked to changes in diet, sexual practices, exercise patterns and other behavioral adjustments. The worrisome findings in this study are attributable in part to the economic slowdown that occurred in the region during the early 1980s. The study suggests that the vulnerability of the health systems in the country sample is also due to the following: 1) lack of emphasis on primary curative and preventive services; 2) chronic shortages of doctors and other key health personnel; 3) limited involvement of private providers and local government entities; 4) extensive but seemingly undiscriminating use of donor assistance; and 5) low levels of user charges for publicly supported services. The study offers recommendations to address each of these problems.",,Health priorities and options in the World Bank's Pacific member countries,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/423571468777017180/text/multi0page.txt,/research/1994/10/697978/health-priorities-options-world-banks-pacific-member-countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/423571468777017180/Health-priorities-and-options-in-the-World-Banks-Pacific-member-countries,1994/10/697978/health-priorities-options-world-banks-pacific-member-countries,423571468777017180,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/423571468777017180/Health-priorities-and-options-in-the-World-Banks-Pacific-member-countries,D697978,null,,,"(Historic)Primary health, including reproductive health, child health and health",,,,,,,,,,,Epidemiology; Infant mortality; Life expectancy (human); Fertility; Parasitic diseases; Immunization; Venereal diseases; Nutrition; Noncommunicable diseases; Primary health care; Health services; Health manpower; Health expenditures; Prenatal care; Preventive medicine; Quality of life; Nongovernmental organizations; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; Donor participation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But in this same world, around 2.5 billion people-almost half the developing world population-live on dollar 2 or less a day. Of these, about 1 billion earn less than dollar 1 day. For these people, the many effects of poverty are life-altering. For example, in developing countries, an estimated 33,000 children die every day from avoidable causes, and every minute at least one woman dies in childbirth. Poverty additionally keeps more than 100 million children most of them girls-out of school. To further complicate matters, many obstacles exist that make it difficult for people to escape poverty's grasp. Inadequate infrastructure hinders access to health care, education, jobs, and trade; poor health and lack of education, in turn, deprive people of productive employment; and corruption, conflict, and poor governance waste public resources and private investment. In the face of such obstacles, the challenge of reducing poverty is both enormous and complex. But with the world's population growing by an estimated 3 billion people over the next 50 years, and with the vast majority of those people residing in developing countries, it is a challenge that must be met. The range of interventions includes support for sound governance, sustainable development, inclusive delivery of social services, improved infrastructure, private sector development, and job creation. The Bank Group's work focuses on achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which call for eliminating poverty and achieving sustained development. The goals are used to set the Bank Group's priorities and they provide targets and yardsticks for measuring results. They are the Bank Group's road map for development.",,Perspectives on development : fall 2008,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/426581468336318228/pdf/563650WP0Box349502B01PUBLIC1.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/426581468336318228/text/563650WP0Box349502B01PUBLIC1.txt,/research/2008/01/12716307/perspectives-development-fall-2008,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/426581468336318228/Perspectives-on-development-fall-2008,2008/01/12716307/perspectives-development-fall-2008,426581468336318228,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/426581468336318228/Perspectives-on-development-fall-2008,D12716307,190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some lessons learned included: Strong ownership and commitment at the highest levels of government, together with a group of empowered, reform-minded professionals charged with the task of implementing major reform projects and who understand the major risks and strategies to overcome them is critical to ultimate success of a reform project. An ability to change project details in response to a dynamic and positive national policy environment is also important. Designed appropriately, projects provide a very good platform for sound policy dialogue and reform strategy design and implementation. Project training can contribute to overall capacity building, support implementation of changed technical protocols and processes for service delivery, and help institutionalize management systems when systematically conducted. Community participation and stakeholder consultations assist with both ownership and clarity of objectives and implementation strategies. The internal policy of Government of China (GOC) which requires under-resourced counties to repay Bank credits creates serious problems for counties (and provinces) and ultimately impacts on the fees charged or the viability of hospitals and service providers to the extent they become liable for the repayment. It also creates, inappropriately, a reluctance to spend on quality enhancing training, technical assistance, and other intangible items of expenditure.

Persuasive microeconomic evidence suggests that inequalities in wealth, power, and status have efficiency costs. These variables capture different aspects of people's opportunity sets, for which observed income may be a poor proxy. One implication is that the cross-country literature on income inequality and growth may have been barking up the wrong tree, and that alternative measures of the relevant distributions are needed. The authors review some of the detailed microeconomic evidence, and then suggest three research areas where further work is needed.","Policy, Research working paper ; no.

La muerte de una mujer en edad reproductiva se traduce en dificultades econ&#243;micas y sociales importantes para su familia y la comunidad.

The analysis by indicator looks at trends and prospects for reaching the MDG indicator targets. The paper provides a look at the policy and institutional changes required to increase the likelihood of meeting these targets. The conclusions suggest that Yemen has made significant progress on the MDG targets, especially when one considers that Yemen started relatively late, largely due to historical reasons. It seems likely that by 2015, Yemen may achieve the primary education target, the elimination of gender gap within primary education target, and the absolute poverty reduction target, provided that the policy and institutional reforms recommended are implemented and donor support is forthcoming. As for maternal and child health targets, at present they are unlikely to be met, as are targets for access to safe drinking water in rural areas. Even for the most promising indicators, any progress towards achieving the MDGs will require significant institutional and policy reforms by Government and continued, coordinated support from donors. Another necessity for achieving the targets is political stability and relative peace.",Middle East and North Africa working paper series ; no. 31,Yemen and the Millennium Development Goals,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/149201468767063210/text/270220PAPER0MNA031.txt,/research/2003/03/2622294/yemen-millennium-development-goals,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/149201468767063210/Yemen-and-the-Millennium-Development-Goals,2003/03/2622294/yemen-millennium-development-goals,149201468767063210,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/149201468767063210/Yemen-and-the-Millennium-Development-Goals,D2622294,null,"Qaiser Khan, and Susan Chase",,,,,,,,,,,,,maternal and child health services;access to basic health service;rural access to drinking water;access to safe drinking water;improve Education Quality;infant and child mortality;gender gap in primary;share of education spending;maternal mortality and morbidity;gender disparity in education;access to safe water;gender gap in enrolment;net primary enrolment ratio;rural area;poverty reduction target;primary school enrolment;universal primary education;universal primary enrolment;share of woman;national poverty line;economic growth targets;indoor air pollution;number of women;Oil &Gas;Oil and Gas;food poverty line;education and health;vitamin a supplementation;high fertility rate;living in poverty;social welfare spending;wages and salary;access to school;child survival intervention;decline in remittance;employment for woman;population growth rate;social welfare fund;scarcity of water;labor force participation;high population growth;cost of transportation;Oral rehydration therapies;weight for age;girls in school;enrolment of girl;maternal mortality rate;lack of transportation;primary education enrolment;availability of drug;operations and maintenance;provision of material;lack of regulation;incidence of malaria;per capita income;poor financial management;gross enrolment rate;growth in agriculture;persistent gender gap;health reform program;poor maternal health;spread of hiv;public primary education;contraceptive prevalence rate;continuity of care;primary school teacher;public works program;world development;public water network;decline in mortality;quality of governance;basic education system;safety net program;management of school;proportion of female;family planning education;rift valley fever;cost of capital;public sector borrowing;care during pregnancy;infant mortality rate;maternal mortality reduction;provision of textbook;expenditure on food;quality of health;complete primary school;prevalence of underweight;prevalence of malnutrition;death among women;maternal health care;improved water source;absence of teacher;acute respiratory infection;net enrolment rate;live birth;national parliament;school construction;female teacher;Women's Education;maternal death;health facility;government commitment;donor support;Gender Equality;Public Spending;public health;diarrheal disease;good governance;secondary enrolment;public support;neonatal services;desert region;mountainous region;early age;puerperal sepsis;extreme poverty;mountainous area;environmental sustainability;poverty headcount;supply side;post abortion;early marriage;reform scenario;skilled staff;quality improvement;public finance;financial requirement;youth literacy;agriculture sector;malaria treatment;girls education;women's right;agricultural employment;community participation;family attitude;curative care;child immunization;care seeking;management problems;social insurance;nutrition behavior;caloric intake;complementary feeding;risk pool;targeted program;caesarean section;lifetime risk;animal disease;reproductive age;support network;external support;tetanus toxoid;coastal region;postpartum care;attendance rate;hospital autonomy;viral hepatitis;health practice;emergency service;poverty program;Infectious Disease;physical work;heavy burden;obstetrics complications;domestic labor;non-governmental organization;neonatal care;financial problem;education cost;health condition;Endemic Disease;newborn mortality;congenital malformations;delivery complications;newborn deaths;inadequate food;medical supply;urban child;subject area;Civil War;financial constraint;health infrastructure;social reasons;utilization rate;tertiary care;geographic area;real income;governance environment;obstructed labor;essential services;boom-bust cycle;instructional material;underweight child;global partnership;sustainable access;greater access;rural water;urban water;basic school;children of ages;income decile;household behavior;highland areas;coastal plain;Indicator Target;comparative advantage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collapse of the Convertibility Plan, the freezing of bank deposits and the default on foreign debts, and the resulting high inflation, falling output and exchange rate devaluation, carried with it severe consequences for the poor. The break with the Convertibility Plan also meant that the adjustment in the labor market, occurred more through wages, rather than by an increase in unemployment. Inflation reduced real wages substantially, and, unlike previous recessions, unemployment arose largely from the formal sector, with an increase in employment in the informal sector. Many of the middle class, faced with both declining wages and freeze on bank assets, moved into poverty for the first time, carrying characteristics somewhat different than the traditional poor, including higher levels of education. Households appear to cope through a variety of strategies, including the entry into the workforce of those not previously employed, and reduced consumption of food, and other products. The Government's response to move to a floating exchange rate, and the consequent reduction in real wages, has provided the basis for a potential recovery. The reduction in real public sector wages, and pension obligations with inflation, while nominal revenues increased, has temporarily provided for an improved fiscal balance. The government, however, still faces serious issues in fiscal, and financial sector management. And Government programs still do not provide an adequate safety net for the unemployed on a permanent basis. Safety net programs are costly and duplicate other programs. Smaller, inefficient programs should be combined. Educational services need to be maintained, particularly with regard to payment of teachers, as the welfare effects go beyond the immediate income levels of teachers; in the health sector, gradual implementation of an infant and maternal health insurance, and the definition of, and agreement on provincial health goals (with monitorable health indicators) seem to be two key initial steps towards more effective protection for the uninsured poor, including other chronic inefficiencies in the health sector. Longer term poverty reduction measures include policy reforms towards higher levels of employment, access to basic services by the poor by improving infrastructure, and, improved human capital, and their productivity.",,Argentina - Crisis and poverty 2003 - a poverty assessment : Main Report,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/954181468767959456/text/261270AR.txt,/research/2003/07/2539789/argentina-crisis-poverty-2003-poverty-assessment-main-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/954181468767959456/Main-Report,2003/07/2539789/argentina-crisis-poverty-2003-poverty-assessment-vol-1-2-main-report,954181468767959456,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/954181468767959456/Main-Report,D2539789,null,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Other social services,Health,Other Education,Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance",South America,,,,,,,,,,informal sector;care needs;Labor Market;Alcohol and Drug Abuse;average per capita income;average number of child;long-term poverty reduction;high level of employment;effectiveness of health care;dropping out of school;real growth;public health care expenditures;higher level of education;maternal and child health;basic food basket;health insurance coverage;formal sector worker;safety net program;progressive income tax;exchange rate devaluation;crime and violence;consumer price index;public hospital system;average poverty rate;means of transportation;economies of scale;unit labor costs;coefficient of variation;total worker;social security system;severance payment;real wage;years of schooling;access to goods;access to justice;lack of money;infrastructure service provider;effects of unemployment;official poverty line;partial cost recovery;source income;demonstrations and protests;upper income quintile;crimes against property;basic social service;labor force reduction;adequate safety net;labor force growth;shortage of funds;reproductive health service;food poverty line;world development indicator;human resource development;child in school;source of employment;total wage bill;primary health care;maternal health insurance;stable economic growth;health insurance system;payment of teacher;termination of employment;Labor Market Flexibility;income on water;total labor force;skills and education;demand for service;decline in poverty;public sector wage;income due;small scale enterprise;collective bargaining agreement;lack of resource;real estate price;national urban poverty;demand for labor;secondary school attendance;labor market characteristic;source of income;school dropout rate;foreign direct investment;perceptions of risk;withdrawal of deposit;expenditures on school;division of labor;average family size;rates of return;case of health;cost of living;public sector borrowing;high fertility rate;Type of Investment;privatization of state;increase in labor;rate of inflation;quality of education;public health facility;rural area;social spending;nominal wage;social program;household survey;unemployment insurance;Public Services;labor code;real income;Exchange Rates;cheap products;bank deposit;adult equivalent;urban poor;economic crisis;public university;start school;school material;unstable income;free access;middle class;financial crisis;informal worker;tariff increase;rural population;poverty elasticity;Private School;salaried worker;university study;medical service;macro policies;macro policy;large families;social policies;social policy;cash grant;convertibility plan;education level;Higher Education;tax base;preventive care;small depositor;financial system;scale economy;high-income group;basic infrastructure;consumption level;family home;average wage;full employment;community activity;Financial Sector;Labor Law;financial sustainability;living condition;government issue;feeding program;education service;supply side;low-income group;public wage;overdue payment;budget cut;school leaving;illegal use;deferred payment;police protection;health area;social cost;Education Services;unemployment decline;connection program;school feeding;payment scheme;infrastructure sector;household head;Social Conflict;federal transfer;labor taxes;medical coverage;temporary employment;payroll tax;school year;coverage rate;charitable organization;psychological impact;hepatitis b;male participation;walking increase;Elderly People;attending school;society increases;social dislocation;consumption survey;civil right;foreign debt;health insurer;insurance program;cultural consumption;globalized economy;focus group;scarce resource;survey data;enrollment rate;wage adjustment;health outcome;improved service;legal title;social discrimination;Informal Economy;unequal distribution;public building;domestic service;lower-income group;secondary level;negative effect;expenditure share;civil rights;government action;expenditure pattern;chronic inefficiency;Public Transport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, pharmaceutical expenditure in comparative perspective is not particularly high on a per capita basis or as a percentage of GDP. China's exceptionally high rate of pharmaceutical expenditure has important implications for the future of a health care system that not only serves a rapidly aging population, but encourages overuse of drugs in ways that are both financially and medically inefficient. Pharmaceutical reform is therefore a high priority for China's health policymakers. Several factors are discussed for reforming this system based on lessons from recent reforms. The section following this introduction briefly reviews the expansion of basic medical insurance coverage in the 2000s and several structural features of the pharmaceutical sector in China. The related concepts of an essential medicines policy, an essential drug list, and a generic drug policy are briefly described in first section. The second section of the paper looks at several hurdles that are built into the path of essential medicines reform. The third section considers some lessons for pharmaceutical reform based on China's recent learning from regional experimentation and piloting initiatives. The fourth section considers several relevant lessons derived from reform experiences in other countries. The fifth section looks at the path forward-success factors for implementing an essential medicines program based on low-cost generic drugs.",China health policy notes ; no. 4,A generic drug policy as cornerstone to essential medicines in China (Vol. 2) : Main report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/922831468215970921/pdf/584130NWP0V20P10No41Pharma0Generics.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/922831468215970921/text/584130NWP0V20P10No41Pharma0Generics.txt,/research/2010/06/13240428/generic-drug-policy-cornerstone-essential-medicines-china-vol-2-main-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/922831468215970921/Main-report,2010/06/13240428/generic-drug-policy-cornerstone-essential-medicines-china-vol-2-2-main-report,922831468215970921,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/922831468215970921/Main-report,D13240428,51,,,Health,East Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the likelihood of asbestos presence in a hazardous form, poses concerns during the renovation process, not only as related to patients, but to the public at large. Moreover, medical wastes generated by health facilities, are considered hazardous materials that may be infectious, toxic, or radioactive, which should be handled in accordance with standard medical, and biomedical waste management disposal practices. The first volume focuses on the issue of asbestos, and offers guidance as follows: should demolition activities generate visible airborne dust, the contractor(s) will cease activities until the dust is controlled, namely by water spraying; and, demolition contractors should include in their bids, techniques to control, and monitor materials of potential environmental concern, such as that in the resilient floor covering, and Transite board materials found at the Vaiola Hospital. Asbestos should be removed from demolition debris, treated as hazardous material, kept adequately wet until disposed of in accordance with international standards. The second volume identifies medical waste management issues, and proposes initially the development of a health care waste management policy, and comprehensive plan, that includes training and public awareness, supported by appropriate legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks. Mitigation measures call for the proper disposal of segregated infectious medical wastes, using options such as autoclave, landfill, and existing incineration, as the case may require. A sanitary wastewater treatment system should be installed at Vaiola Hospital, while the use of disinfected effluents for irrigation, and sanitary sludge composting for soil amendment, should be evaluated.",,Tonga - Health Sector Support Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 2) : Health care waste management feasibility study,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/389131468111887754/pdf/multi0page.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/389131468111887754/text/multi0page.txt,/projects/documents/2002/03/2210555/tonga-health-sector-support-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-health-care-waste-management-feasibility-study,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/389131468111887754/Health-care-waste-management-feasibility-study,2002/03/2210555/Health-care-waste-management-feasibility-study,389131468111887754,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/389131468111887754/Health-care-waste-management-feasibility-study,D2210555,61,"Picardi, Alfred - Environmental Management Consu",,Health,,,,,,,,,,,Environmental assessment; Asbestos safety measures; Asbestos abatement; Spraying; Hospital equipment; Health care facilities; Waste management; Capacity building; Legal & regulatory framework; Law enforcement; Training assistance; Public awareness; Institutional framework; Environmental protection; Medical wastes; Sanitation equipment; Waste disposal; Landfills; Incineration environmental aspects; Biomedical materials; Hazardous waste sites; Hazardous waste disposal; Effluents; Water treatment; Disinfection; Sludge treatment; Soil amendments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lessons learned indicate that water plant management practices need to be streamlined, with an emphasis on strengthening financial management and accounting practices. Standard accounting formats should be used in all Water Treatment Plants (WTPs) with on-the-job training imparted to plant staff. Demand management needs strengthening. More emphasis needs to be put on: (a) accurately forecasting demand for piped water supply to optimize plant size and production capacity; and (b) stimulating demand for safe water by conducting effective hygiene promotion campaigns as well as raising revenues to finance the cost of production. Procurement should be decentralized. Centralized procurement led to delays in project implementation.

The use of well-defined indicators linked to expected outcomes, agreed ex-ante with the Borrower, serves an important dual purpose: first, it helps improve project design and implementation by ensuring focus, and aligning interventions towards the achievement of a set of clear benchmarks; and, second, it helps the Borrower, central and local governments in centering their policy dialogue on specific actions. For the successful introduction of such a results-oriented culture, several conditions need to be in place: Policy instruments are needed to bring the nationally agreed targets to the operational level; Incentives, to comply with set targets and sustain the level of effort and interest; and, The health sector must have the appropriate means to reach the agreed upon targets.

Increasingly, problems seen in schooling such as high repetition, early dropout rates, and poor learning, as well as poor health of youths and adults, are being traced to malnutrition, poor health, and abuse very early in the lives of children. Many studies have examined the consequences of child malnutrition and its impact on child schooling decisions and academic achievement; investments in preschool children improve later school success and therefore adult work productivity and incomes. Statistically significant positive associations are found between family background and schooling and child health, and a positive relationship between mother's schooling and child immunization rates has been observed across world regions.",,A better start in life: the early childhood development program in the Philippines,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/790701468776059207/text/307850PH0Early0Ed1ECD01see0also0307591.txt,/research/2004/05/5520456/better-start-life-early-childhood-development-program-philippines,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/790701468776059207/A-better-start-in-life-the-early-childhood-development-program-in-the-Philippines,2004/05/5520456/better-start-life-early-childhood-development-program-philippines,790701468776059207,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/790701468776059207/A-better-start-in-life-the-early-childhood-development-program-in-the-Philippines,D5520456,null,"Behrman,Jere R.","King,Elizabeth M.",,Southeast Asia,,"Laigo, Lina",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NACP Phase I was launched in 1992, followed by Phase II in 1999 and Phase III in 2006. Due to extensive coverage and intense efforts, prevalence of HIV infection among adults has decreased from 0.41% in 2000 to 0.31% in 2009, which is remarkable. Presently, NACP IV is being launched with the vision that, by 2020, the number of HIV infected people in India, will gradually come to low levels and HIV could become a chronic manageable illness in India. According to the draft strategy paper for NACP IV, the program plans to bring about significant reduction in new HIV infections.The proposed World Bank support to NACO through National AIDS Control Support Project (NACSP) is the fourth phase (2012-17). Efforts towards Infection Control and Waste Management have already been introduced under NACP Phase III, which has a component of Infection Control and Waste Management (IC-WM). A wide range of activities have been undertaken during NACP III in this direction. To name a few: development of guidelines on ICWM, training manuals, training of various categories of medical and other technical professionals, special focus and guidelines on needles disposal and management for IDU interventions, ensuring adequate supplies for Personal Protective Equipment and inclusion of IC activities through TI monitoring reports",,India - National AIDS Control Support Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/476851468267878152/pdf/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/476851468267878152/text/NonAsciiFileName0.txt,/projects/documents/2012/12/17170847/india-national-aids-control-support-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/476851468267878152/India-National-AIDS-Control-Support-Project,2012/12/17170847/india-national-aids-control-support-project,476851468267878152,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/476851468267878152/India-National-AIDS-Control-Support-Project,D17170847,61,,,Health,South Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitigation measures include restoring irrigation facilities or providing compensation; removing cultural relics during excavation for placement in a museum; reinforcing building structures to withstand vibrations. To control soil erosion avoid hill cutting, deep digging, or high filling; build a drainage system and guard works (temporary retaining wall and settling basins) to collect run-off, plant fast-growing trees along access roads and cover the road embankments with grass; restore topsoil layer; and maintain a balance between borrowing and depositing. To reduce noise, erect noise barriers (fences and trees as buffers), schedule work for daytime, regulate speed and ban horn blowing, prevent noisy equipment from operating at night, and monitor noise volume. To minimize impacts to water quality, construct wastewater treatment facilities, separate oil from water and reuse wastewater or treat wastewater in septic tank before discharging it into irrigation system and keep harmful chemicals from riverside and cover them with geo-textiles. To mitigate air pollution, locate mixing stations away from sensitive areas, and plant a greenbelt area to reduce increased nitrous oxide, water unpaved ground as frequently as needed. Maintain landscape coherence and compatibility. To avert impacts to water quality caused by traffic accidents with vehicles transporting hazardous materials, install drains and crash-proof railing on bridges. Build temporary roads to avoid traffic jams. To foster worker and public health and safety, provide training about HIV and SARS, ensure drinking water quality meets national standards, provide protective gear (earplugs, helmets), improve management of explosives, protect against poisonous snakes and epidemics, isolate staff from SARS epidemic areas, and install traffic warning signs and impose speed limits. To protect biodiversity, promote environmental awareness, schedule blasting to minimize interference with wild animals, and avoid forested areas.",,China - Hubei Shiman Highway Project : environmental impact assessment (Vol. 3) : Baozhu rural road - environmental impact assessment and environmental management plan,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/157281468744329819/text/E8750VOL103010PAPER.txt,/projects/documents/2003/10/2962634/china-hubei-shiman-highway-project-environmental-impact-assessment-vol-3-baozhu-rural-road-environmental-impact-assessment-environmental-management-plan,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/157281468744329819/Baozhu-rural-road-environmental-impact-assessment-and-environmental-management-plan,2003/10/2962634/china-hubei-shiman-highway-project-environmental-impact-assessment-vol-3-6-baozhu-rural-road-environmental-impact-assessment-environmental-management-plan,157281468744329819,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/157281468744329819/Baozhu-rural-road-environmental-impact-assessment-and-environmental-management-plan,D2962634,null,"China,Andreea-Mirela",,"Roads and highways,Sub-National Government",Asia,,,,,,,,,,Irrigation systems; Soil erosion control structures; Cultural conservation; Drainage systems; Drainage basins; Drainage ditches; Tree planting; Tree protection; Noise abatement; Noise barriers; Scheduling; Water quality management; Habitat conservation; Environmental awareness; Biodiversity management; Disease control & prevention strategies; Acute respiratory infections; HIV AIDS prevention; Explosives safety regulations; Protective clothing; Occupational health & safety; Traffic control; Traffic accidents; Wastewater treatment; Septic tanks; Hazardous materials control; Air pollution control; Nitrous oxide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
