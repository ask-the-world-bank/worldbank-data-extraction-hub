Forecasting relies on numerical weather prediction (NWP), which is significantly impacted by the availability of meteorological observations, with space-based observations being the most important. Surface-based observations also contribute substantially to NWP performance, but current availability in Antarctica, Africa, South America, the Pacific and parts of Asia is insufficient. More observations from these regions would improve global NWP and forecasting quality, particularly in the data-sparse regions themselves, but also over the rest of the globe. It is estimated that improvements in the coverage and exchange of surface-based observations to meet the World Meteorological Organization’s Global Basic Observing Network (GBON) specification can deliver additional global socioeconomic benefits of over five billion annually. This is a conservative estimate omitting non-financial benefits such as potential lives saved and improvements to well-being, so underestimates the full benefits, particularly for developing countries. Investing in improving surface-based observations in data sparse regions is also highly economically efficient, yielding a global benefit to cost ratio of over twenty-five. Assuming sufficient observational coverage, international data exchange is a very efficient multiplier of the value of observations. However, exchange is currently insufficient across all regions. In view of the growing climate- and weather-related challenges facing humanity and recognizing that climate services similarly rely on meteorological monitoring, surface-based observations should be treated as a critical public good, with public oversight and open exchange within the meteorological and climatological communities.",The Value of Surface-based Meteorological Observation Data,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/192461614151036836/pdf/The-Value-of-Surface-based-Meteorological-Observation-Data.pdf,/research/2021/01/32857476/value-surface-based-meteorological-observation-data,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/192461614151036836/The-Value-of-Surface-based-Meteorological-Observation-Data,192461614151036836,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/192461614151036836/The-Value-of-Surface-based-Meteorological-Observation-Data,D32857476,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EO-based services can be undertaken at varying spatial scales from local to global and they allow generating information in a non-intrusive, objective, and consistent manner around the world. The World Bank and the European space agency (ESA) have partnered for the purpose of mainstreaming the use of EO in the World Bank's lending operations, across all of the sustainable development networks sectors. ESA's directorate of earth observation programs, and the World Bank's finance, economics, and urban department have therefore launched eoworld. The aim of this initiative is to establish a stable connection between the specific information needs of the World Bank projects and the new developments in EO programs and services. In particular eoworld gives the World Bank the opportunity to benefit from ESA's 30 years of experience in collecting and distributing EO data to users around the world, and in developing innovative information services for various applications to be used by public organizations, national authorities, and private sector operators in their development projects.

In most of these projects, the share of the investment in the modernization of networks has been between 40 and 50 percent of the total project costs. The objectives of these initiatives have been to create reliable analyses, numerical predictions, and forecasts to inform early action, response, and planning across the whole of society. In some countries, monitoring networks have been sustained and improved over the decades. But in others, maintaining them operationally has remained elusive, resulting not only in inoperable or poorly maintained observational infrastructure and systems but also in a failure to realize the intended benefits. Why did some succeed where others did not That is a question that this report tries to answer by exploring the underpinnings of the successes and the possibilities of replicating these successes elsewhere, and thereby contribute to the body of knowledge on observation networks. This report aims to facilitate the development of more strategic and viable roadmaps for investments in weather and climate observation networks where those investments are likely to be substantial in the coming decades, as countries improve resilience to natural hazards and economies transform in response to climate change challenge.",Charting a Course for Sustainable Hydrological and Meteorological Observation Networks in Developing Countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099130009262226463/pdf/P17694509a843d057086ef08bfc8d7d464d.pdf,/research/2022/10/33906787/charting-course-sustainable-hydrological-meteorological-observation-networks-developing-countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099130009262226463/P17694509a843d057086ef08bfc8d7d464d,099130009262226463,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099130009262226463/P17694509a843d057086ef08bfc8d7d464d,D33906787,315,2022/10/33906787/P17694509a843d057086ef08bfc8d7d464d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other Public Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NCHM is mandated to observe and understand the behaviour of the atmosphere over Bhutan, its interaction with the cryosphere and water bodies, the weather and climate of the country, and the distribution of the country’s water resources. The Centre is identified as the nodal agency responsible for generation of information and delivery of products and services on weather, climate, cryosphere, and water resources in Bhutan. It was formed as an autonomous scientific and technical agency in 2016, having previously been a part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The establishment of the NCHM has brought together into a single organisation the study of all aspects of meteorology, climatology, hydrology, and cryosphere (glaciology and related science) in Bhutan, as well as aviation meteorology. In December 2019, the National Disaster Management Authority chaired by the Prime Minister designated the NCHM as the National Hydromet Hazard Early Warning Service Provider, pursuant to the Disaster Management Act 2013 to ensure clear and systematic early warning and notification to vulnerable populations and government agencies of threatening hydrometeorological hazards, disaster situations or events in the country. NCHM does not have access to spaces designed for 24/7 operational work. In order that its capacities may be fully used to the benefit of the citizens of Bhutan and serve as a regional Centre of Excellence on mountain meteorology, it needs to have facilities for education and outreach so that users can learn how best to take advantage of advanced forecast and warning information.","Bhutan - Technical Guidance Note for Establishment of National Centre for Hydrology and Meteorology Head Quarter, National Weather, and Flood Warning Centre and Scientific Facilities",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099731006292342997/pdf/IDU01074274002894045940a3b404e5f81373970.pdf,/research/2023/06/34105975/bhutan-technical-guidance-note-establishment-national-centre-hydrology-meteorology-head-quarter-national-weather-flood-warning-centre-scientific-facilities,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099731006292342997/IDU01074274002894045940a3b404e5f81373970,099731006292342997,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099731006292342997/IDU01074274002894045940a3b404e5f81373970,D34105975,46,2023/06/34105975/IDU01074274002894045940a3b404e5f81373970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper discusses non-traditional approaches for establishing sustainable weather observing networks in developing countries, beginning with a brief overview of the importance of data from such networks to a NHMS. Some of the challenges inherent in establishing and maintaining weather and climate observing networks in developing countries are described. This is followed by a discussion of how these challenges may be addressed through the development of weather observing networks based on facilities and capabilities of the local cellular telephone network, such as the open lattice tower pictured in the background of the cover photograph. The paper reviews and summarizes currently available scientific, technical, and commercial literature regarding use of cell phone towers as observing sites. It provides a few illustrative examples of non-traditional technologies well-suited to making cell-tower based observations. The paper concludes with recommendations concerning how one may work with NHMSs in developing countries to improve the sustainability of their observing networks. These recommendations are focused on partnerships, in the sense of true business relationships, involving the NHMSs with, for example, local telephone companies, other in-country utilities, and commercial and private sector instrument manufacturers and data services.",Non-traditional approaches to weather observations in developing countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/674601487155273152/pdf/112822-WP-Non-Traditional-Approaches-to-Weather-Observations-PUBLIC.pdf,/research/2013/01/27192529/non-traditional-approaches-weather-observations-developing-countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/674601487155273152/Non-traditional-approaches-to-weather-observations-in-developing-countries,674601487155273152,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/674601487155273152/Non-traditional-approaches-to-weather-observations-in-developing-countries,D27192529,48,2017/02/27192529/non-traditional-approaches-weather-observations-developing-countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weather, climate, and water affect societies and economies through extreme events, such as tropical cyclones, floods, high winds, storm surges, and prolonged droughts, and through high-impact weather and climate events that affect demand for electricity and production capacity, planting and harvesting dates, management of construction, transportation networks and inventories, and human health. The key players are the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs), which are the backbone of the global weather and climate enterprise. By international agreement under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), they are the government's authoritative source of weather, climate, and water information, providing timely input to emergency managers, national and local administrations, the public, and critical economic sectors. The report underscores the urgent need to strengthen NMHSs, especially those in developing countries, and provides cost-benefit estimates of the return that countries can hope to achieve. It also offers a recommended approach that has been tested and implemented in Europe, in Central and South Asia, and countries in other regions. The NMHSs make a significant contribution to safety, security, and economic well-being by observing, forecasting, and warning of pending weather, climate, and water threats.",Weather and climate resilience : effective preparedness through national meteorological and hydrological services,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/308581468322487484/pdf/Weather-and-climate-resilience-effective-preparedness-through-national-meteorological-and-hydrological-services.pdf,/research/2013/09/18273238/weather-climate-resilience-effective-preparedness-through-national-meteorological-hydrological-services,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/308581468322487484/Weather-and-climate-resilience-effective-preparedness-through-national-meteorological-and-hydrological-services,308581468322487484,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/308581468322487484/Weather-and-climate-resilience-effective-preparedness-through-national-meteorological-and-hydrological-services,D18273238,163,2013/09/18273238/weather-climate-resilience-effective-preparedness-through-national-meteorological-hydrological-services,,,,,,,,,,,,,"978-1-4648-0026-9,978-1-4648-0027-6",,,,,,,Directions in development : environment and sustainable development,,,,,,

In light of Japan’s geographical and climatological features, the country’s natural hazards comprise weather, climate, ocean, and seismic-related hazards. Through the extensive efforts of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and its collaborating authorities in improving early warning and disaster management systems and in raising public awareness, the damage caused by natural disasters and the impacts on socio-economic activities have been significantly reduced. The modernization of meteorological services in Japan has been achieved step by step in accordance with the evolution of JMA operational services through strategic investments in service delivery improvement to meet evolving and diversifying societal needs. JMA, in collaboration with the relevant authorities, provides operational early warning services in order to reduce the risks from multiple natural hazards. The lessons learned in Japan in the modernization of meteorological services and the experiences in international programs and projects can be utilized as comprehensive strategic guidance for developing countries.",Modernization of Meteorological Services in Japan and Lessons for Developing Countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/467421495018952151/pdf/Modernization-of-meteorological-services-in-Japan-and-lessons-for-developing-countries.pdf,/research/2017/01/27475722/modernization-meteorological-services-japan-lessons-developing-countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/467421495018952151/Modernization-of-meteorological-services-in-Japan-and-lessons-for-developing-countries,467421495018952151,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/467421495018952151/Modernization-of-meteorological-services-in-Japan-and-lessons-for-developing-countries,D27475722,174,2017/05/27475722/modernization-meteorological-services-japan-lessons-developing-countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management",Natural disaster management,Social protection and risk management,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness of early warning systems designed to reduce exposure to hazards depends on people’s capacity to understand and respond to a given situation. This remains a challenge in most countries and is a high priority in PICs, where early action is essential to save lives and to protect livelihoods and property. A common approach to multi-hazard early warning systems (MHEWSs) has been advocated by national meteorological services (NMSs), which are primarily responsible for forecasts and warnings of weather, climate, and geo-hazards. MHEWS inform the people of the potential impacts of impending natural hazards, the risks on their lives and livelihoods, and the action they should take. To be effective, this approach entails multistakeholder cooperation and coordination between and among national science, disaster risk management agencies, and other relevant stakeholders. The aim of this assessment is to validate gaps, which have been identified in the capacities of these agencies to minimize the adverse impacts of meteorological and geophysical hazards (hereafter natural hazards), which can result in disasters that affect the entire economic, human, and physical environment and impact the long-term development of the Kingdom of Tonga.",Early Warning System Needs Assessment and Investment Plan for the Pacific Islands : Tonga,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/423071584942318258/pdf/Early-Warning-System-Needs-Assessment-and-Investment-Plan-for-the-Pacific-Islands-Tonga.pdf,/research/2020/01/31884306/early-warning-system-needs-assessment-investment-plan-pacific-islands-tonga,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/423071584942318258/Early-Warning-System-Needs-Assessment-and-Investment-Plan-for-the-Pacific-Islands-Tonga,423071584942318258,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/423071584942318258/Early-Warning-System-Needs-Assessment-and-Investment-Plan-for-the-Pacific-Islands-Tonga,D31884306,19,2020/01/31884306/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It summarizes two detailed and comprehensive supporting reports: a background paper by the Japan Meteorological Business Support Center (JMBSC) on meteorological services; and a background paper by the Foundation of River and Basin Integrated Communications, Japan (FRICS), on hydrology and water resources. The background papers and this summary report were commissioned by the World Bank’s disaster risk management (DRM) hub, Tokyo to document the modernization trajectory of Japanese meteorological and hydrological services. Well-prepared and resourced hydrological and meteorological services can warn governments and communities so that this disruption is minimized, and can also aid in rescue and recovery efforts and in reconstruction; daily weather information can help prevent secondary disasters in environments where vulnerability and risk are high, and flood hazard maps, and other tools can guide rebuilding efforts. The present study, which is a comprehensive analysis of Japan’s hydrological and meteorological services, uses the three-component framework developed by Rogers and Tsirkunov for large-scale modernization: institutional strengthening, capacity building, and implementation support (referred to as institutional strengthening); modernization of observation infrastructure and forecasting (referred to as modernization of systems); and enhancement of the service delivery system (referred to as enhanced service delivery).",Modernization of Japan's Hydromet Services : A Report on Lessons Learned for Disaster Risk Management,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995951494919357469/pdf/Modernization-of-Japans-Hydromet-Services-A-Report-on-Lessons-Learned-for-Disaster-Risk-Management.pdf,/research/2017/01/27469432/modernization-japans-hydromet-services-report-lessons-learned-disaster-risk-management,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995951494919357469/Modernization-of-Japans-Hydromet-Services-A-Report-on-Lessons-Learned-for-Disaster-Risk-Management,995951494919357469,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/995951494919357469/Modernization-of-Japans-Hydromet-Services-A-Report-on-Lessons-Learned-for-Disaster-Risk-Management,D27469432,28,2017/05/27469432/modernization-japan’s-hydromet-services-report-lessons-learned-disaster-risk-management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management",Natural disaster management,Social protection and risk management,,,,,,,,,,

The result is often a cycle of a low quality of services that improve slightly following investment in new systems; this is then followed by a steady decline due to lack of maintenance of observational networks and other systems. The upshot is a return to a service with diminished ability to fulfill its public task. This technical note explores management practices and argues that good practice is critical to the success of investments. It considers how advanced NMHSs are managed and how they can create sustainable, high-quality services, as well as their applicability to less-advanced services.

This objective will be achieved through improved forecasts resulting from improved observing networks, the introduction of new technologies, and access to higher resolution global weather and climate products. Service improvements will depend on training both the providers and users of services to be able to tailor information more effectively to users needs. The geographical focus will be countrywide. The project will have social and economic benefits by managing risk in weather-related disasters that disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable populations through improving forecasting, early warning systems and the observed climatology of Yemen. The project consists of the following four components: 1) the first component aims to improve climate resilience in Yemen through institutional strengthening and capacity building by provisioning of weather, climate and water services that meet stakeholders needs by creating the conditions that ensure institutional, staffing and financial sustainability of the key providers; 2) the second component aims to upgrade and expand the observations networks for meteorology, agro-meteorology and hydrometeorology, ensuring that these networks are interoperable; 3) the third component provides for the implementation of a systematic upgrade of the weather, climate and water-related end-to-end services provided to all agencies, communities and individuals; 4) and the fourth component involves program management and knowledge sharing. This last component has three distinct subcomponentsoversight of the overall implementation; support for the program coordination unit; and knowledge sharing including public education and outreach.","Yemen, Republic of - Climate Information System and Pilot Program for Climate Resilience Coordination Project",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/882951468335478058/pdf/747550PAD0RY0C00Box379801B00PUBLIC0.pdf,/projects/documents/2013/08/18324248/yemen-republic-climate-information-system-pilot-program-climate-resilience-coordination-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/882951468335478058/Yemen-Republic-of-Climate-Information-System-and-Pilot-Program-for-Climate-Resilience-Coordination-Project,882951468335478058,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/882951468335478058/Yemen-Republic-of-Climate-Information-System-and-Pilot-Program-for-Climate-Resilience-Coordination-Project,D18324248,88,2013/08/18324248/yemen-republic-climate-information-system-pilot-program-climate-resilience-coordination-project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Public administration - Water, sanitation and flood protection,General finance sector",Climate change,Environment and natural resource management,World,Middle East and North Africa,,,,,,,,

One of the most popular earth observation data sets is the so-called nighttime lights from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Researchers have found positive correlations between nighttime lights and several economic variables. These correlations are based on data measured in levels, with a cross-section of observations within a single time period across countries or other geographic units. The findings suggest that nighttime lights could be used as a proxy for some economic variables, especially in areas or times where data are weak or unavailable. Yet, logic suggests that nighttime lights cannot serve as a good proxy for monitoring the within-in country growth rates all of these variables. Examples examined this paper include constant price gross domestic product, non-agricultural gross domestic product, manufacturing value added, and capital stocks, as well as electricity consumption, total population, and urban population. The study finds that the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program data are quite noisy and therefore the resulting growth elasticities of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program nighttime lights with respect to most of these socioeconomic variables are low, unstable over time, and generate little explanatory power. The one exception for which Defense Meteorological Satellite Program nighttime lights could serve as a proxy is electricity consumption, measured in 10-year intervals. It is hoped that improved data from the recently launched Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership satellite will help expand or improve these outcomes. Testing this should be an important next step.",Nighttime lights revisited : the use of nighttime lights data as a proxy for economic variables,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/613891468195568648/pdf/WPS7496.pdf,/research/2015/11/25467938/nighttime-lights-revisited-use-nighttime-lights-data-proxy-economic-variables,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/613891468195568648/Nighttime-lights-revisited-the-use-of-nighttime-lights-data-as-a-proxy-for-economic-variables,613891468195568648,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/613891468195568648/Nighttime-lights-revisited-the-use-of-nighttime-lights-data-as-a-proxy-for-economic-variables,D25467938,30,2015/11/25467938/Nighttime-lights-revisited-the-use-of-nighttime-lights-data-as-a-proxy-for-economic-variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Policy Research working paper,no.

The potential for similar benefits in the developing world is not only proportional to population, but also to increased hazard risk due to climate and geography, as well as increased exposure to weather due to the state of infrastructure. This analysis estimates that the potential benefits from upgrading to developed-country standards the hydro-meteorological information production and early warning capacity in all developing countries include: (i) between 300 million and 2 billion USD per year of avoided asset losses due to natural disasters; (ii) an average of 23,000 saved lives per year, which is valued between 700 million and 3.5 billion USD per year using the Copenhagen Consensus guidelines; and (iii) between 3 and 30 billion USD per year of additional economic benefits. The total benefits would reach between 4 and 36 billion USD per year. Because some of the most expensive components of early warning systems have already been built (e.g., earth observation satellites, global weather forecasts), these investments are relatively modest, estimated here around 1 billion US per year, reaching benefit-cost ratios between 4 and 36.","A cost effective solution to reduce disaster losses in developing countries : hydro-meteorological services, early warning, and evacuation",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/190261468181486694/pdf/WPS6058.pdf,/projects/documents/2012/05/16255054/cost-effective-solution-reduce-disaster-losses-developing-countries-hydro-meteorological-services-early-warning-evacuation,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/190261468181486694/A-cost-effective-solution-to-reduce-disaster-losses-in-developing-countries-hydro-meteorological-services-early-warning-and-evacuation,190261468181486694,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/190261468181486694/A-cost-effective-solution-to-reduce-disaster-losses-in-developing-countries-hydro-meteorological-services-early-warning-and-evacuation,D16255054,22,2012/05/16255054/cost-effective-solution-reduce-disaster-losses-developing-countries-hydro-meteorological-services-early-warning-evacuation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Policy Research working paper ; no.

Among the factors that are associated with low levels of learning, there is evidence of low instructional dosage (2hr and 5 mins per day), low teacher content knowledge and weak teaching practices in the classroom (Bold et al, 2017; SDI 2018). In this context investing in strengthening teachers’ knowledge and skills is crucial. While governments in the world invest large amounts to continuous professional development, there is a huge variability in teacher training programs effectiveness. This new approach, which is currently under implementation, is based on some principles that are aligned with best international practices, namely the need for ongoing support to teachers rather than one-off lectures and use classroom observation and feedback in the process. Furthermore, this new strategy is proposing a substantial change in Mozambique education system in the way teachers develop their skills by recognizing that teaching is a ‘performance profession’, and as such requires continuous practice ‘on site’ (Lemov et al, 2012). Despite positive elements of the new teacher professional development model, some aspects can be strengthened by: (i) providing resources to simplify lesson planning; (ii) recognizing that lesson study methodology (reviewing lessons plans among peer teachers) may not be effective for teachers who do not master curriculum content or good pedagogical skills; (iii) providing more structure and intense teacher support ; (iv) recognizing that ZIP coordinators and teachers’ schedules and tasks have not been adjusted so they face time constraints to implement the new model.",Aprender Plus : Mozambique Coaching Pilot,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/817421562825103150/pdf/Aprender-Plus-Mozambique-Coaching-Pilot.pdf,/research/2019/06/31201312/aprender-plus-mozambique-coaching-pilot,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/817421562825103150/Aprender-Plus-Mozambique-Coaching-Pilot,817421562825103150,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/817421562825103150/Aprender-Plus-Mozambique-Coaching-Pilot,D31201312,14,2019/06/31201312/aprender-plus-mozambique-coaching-pilot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sub-Saharan Africa,World,Southern Africa,,,,,,,

Credible monitoring involves: (a) functional institutions; (b) operational instruments; (c) trained, motivated individuals; (d) scientific procedures; and (e) dedicated funding. Establishing a regional hydro-meteorological research facility in the HKH Mountains will involve developing solutions in the areas of integrated data collection and analysis procedures, instrument selection and placement, compatibility of monitoring instruments and procedures, training of personnel, procedures related to scale and modeling, ensuring accessibility of monitoring sites, and management, analysis, and archiving of the acquired data, all in the context of processes within the mountain basins, not in the adjacent lowlands. Mountain hydrometeorology is defined by a set of complex, three-dimensional, biophysical environments, produced by interactions among terrain, geology, and meteorology. The homogeneity seen from the distant lowlands becomes a complex mosaic of environments within the headwater basins. Altitude determines the properties of an atmospheric column extending upwards from a point within the mountains. These atmospheric properties determine the potential water and energy budgets at a point, or within a basin, in the mountains. Relief, slope aspect and angle, defines local topography.","Monitoring of glaciers, climate, and runoff in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya mountains",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/127761468197388108/pdf/67668-WP-Glacier-Report-PUBLIC.pdf,/research/2016/01/26048237/monitoring-glaciers-climate-runoff-hindu-kush-himalaya-mountains,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/127761468197388108/Monitoring-of-glaciers-climate-and-runoff-in-the-Hindu-Kush-Himalaya-mountains,127761468197388108,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/127761468197388108/Monitoring-of-glaciers-climate-and-runoff-in-the-Hindu-Kush-Himalaya-mountains,D26048237,152,2016/03/26048237/monitoring-glaciers-climate-runoff-hindu-kush-himalaya-mountains,"Halvorson,Sarah J.","Hewitt,Kenneth","Immerzeel,Walter","Kamp,Ulrich","Krumwiede,Brandon Scott",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hydrometric network expanded rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, reaching a peak of 150 in 1980, and the meteorological network had a similar trajectory. Two decades of war, however, brought instability and insecurity that reduced public resources, capacities, collaboration, and coordination. The institutional framework governing weather, climate and hydrological (hydromet) services as well as early warning (EW) and disaster risk management (DRM) services did not escape these setbacks. In 1996, Taliban forces sacked the meteorology office, ruining equipment and destroying over 100 years of weather records. Hydroelectric production nearly ceased as turbines were destroyed, floodgates blown open, and transmission lines brought down. The civil war and its aftermath led to the degradation of traditional observation networks, prevalence of outdated and inefficient technologies, and lack of modern instruments and information and communication technology (ICT). The absence of forecasts and weather information reversed years of development gains in farming and civil aviation operations. In 1998, an Ariana Afghan Airlines flight in route from Kandahar to Kabul in bad weather crashed into a mountaintop, killing 45 people. From 1998 to 2004, a major drought forced nearly 1 million Afghans from their farms and herds into metropolitan areas, impacting half the agriculture land, killing 3 million livestock, and seriously depleting groundwater resources in Kabul and the Kabul Water Basin.",Strengthening Hydromet and Early Warning Services in Afghanistan : A Road Map,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/976021545165642530/pdf/133069-WP-P168141-PUBLIC-44684-Roadmap-Afghanistan-Report-Dec17-Digital.pdf,/research/2018/12/30707102/strengthening-hydromet-early-warning-services-afghanistan-road-map,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/976021545165642530/Strengthening-Hydromet-and-Early-Warning-Services-in-Afghanistan-A-Road-Map,976021545165642530,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/976021545165642530/Strengthening-Hydromet-and-Early-Warning-Services-in-Afghanistan-A-Road-Map,D30707102,126,2018/12/30707102/strengthening-hydromet-early-warning-services-afghanistan-road-map,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,Asia,South Asia,,,,,,,

There are four components to the project, the first component being institutional strengthening, and capacity building and implementation support of Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM). This component aims to develop and/or strengthen DHM's legal and regulatory frameworks, improve institutional performance as the main provider of weather, climate and hydrological information for the nation, build capacity of personnel and management, ensure operability of the future networks, and support project implementation. The second component is the modernization of the observation networks and forecasting. The third component is the enhancement of the service delivery system of DHM.

Since its inception in 2002 the GGFR partnership has encouraged more vigorous efforts to eliminate flaring, such as re-injecting it into the ground to boost oil production, converting it into liquefied natural gas for shipment, transporting it to markets via pipelines, or using it on site for generation of electricity.","Announcement of Satellite Observations Show Declining Levels of Gas Flaring and Greenhouse Emissions on November 17, 2009",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/565581641283724415/pdf/Announcement-of-Satellite-Observations-Show-Declining-Levels-of-Gas-Flaring-and-Greenhouse-Emissions-on-November-17-2009.pdf,/research/2009/11/33696831/announcement-satellite-observations-show-declining-levels-gas-flaring-greenhouse-emissions-november-17-2009,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/565581641283724415/Announcement-of-Satellite-Observations-Show-Declining-Levels-of-Gas-Flaring-and-Greenhouse-Emissions-on-November-17-2009,565581641283724415,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/565581641283724415/Announcement-of-Satellite-Observations-Show-Declining-Levels-of-Gas-Flaring-and-Greenhouse-Emissions-on-November-17-2009,D33696831,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bank News Release,,,,,,

These solar meteorological stations were installed and operated by Suntrace GmbH company (Germany), and commissioned by the World Bank over the years 2015 to 2018 under the same activity. The data layers show long-term yearly and monthly averages of Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) and Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), and they represent a period of the last 19 years, from 1999 to 2017. The data is calculated by aggregation of sub-hourly map-based time series calculated for the territory of Maldives with 1-km spatial resolution. The aggregated data layers are delivered in the format that is compatible with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Additionally, printable maps are available in digital format and ready-to-use for large-format printing. The accuracy of the data layers is enhanced by the regional adaptation of the Solargis model with use of ground measurements acquired at four high-standard solar meteorological stations located in Maldives.

The accuracy enhanced solar model makes it possible to calculate time series for any location with lower uncertainty. This effort results in more accurate solar resource and meteorological data, used in solar energy yield calculation and financial evaluation of a solar project to be developed in the region. The major benefit is higher confidence and lower costs of solar projects development.The solar meteorological stations were installed and operated by GeoSUN Africa (South Africa) in collaboration with SGS Zambia. The stations are located within the premises of Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD), Zambia Agriculture Research Institute (ZARI) and School of Agricultural Sciences at University of Zambia (UNZA) over years 2015 to 2017. The project was funded by the World Bank. The output of the model calculation are aggregated data layers, in the data format that is compatible with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The data represent long-term yearly and monthly averages of Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) and Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), and they cover a period of the 24 years, from 1994 to 2017. The data is calculated by aggregation of sub-hourly map-based time series calculated for the territory of Zambia with 1 km spatial resolution. Additionally, printable maps are available in the digital format and ready-to-use for large-format printing. The accuracy of the data layers is enhanced by the regional adaptation of the Solargis model with use of ground measurements acquired at six high-accuracy standard solar meteorological stations located in Zambia. The measurements helped to reduce systematic deviation of the data inputs to the Solargis model as driving factors of the uncertainty in the region. Individual improvements of the Solargis model at the stations in Zambia are shown in the table below.

Tasks such as weather modelling, earthquake fault line rupture, or the development of dynamic urban exposure measures involve complex science and large amounts of data from a range of sources. Even experts can struggle to develop models that enable the understanding of the potential impacts of a hazard on the built environment and society.In this context, this guidance note explores how new approaches in machine learning can provide newways of looking into these complex relationships and provide more accurate, efficient, and useful answers. The goal of this document is to provide a concise, demystifying reference that readers, from project managers to data scientists, can use to better understand how machine learning can be applied in disaster risk management projects. There are many sources of information on this complex and evolving set of technologies. Therefore, this guidance note is aimed to be as focused as possible, providing basic information and DRM-specific case studies and directing readers to additional resources including online videos, infographics, courses, and articles for further reference. A machine learning (ML) algorithm is a type of computer program that learns to perform specific tasks based on various data inputs or rules provided by its designer. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), but the two terms are often used interchangeably. For a thorough discussion of the differences and similarities of the terms ML and AI, see Section 2. As the name implies, an ML algorithm’s purpose is to “learn” from previous data and output a result that adds information and insight that was not previously known. This approach enables actions to be taken on the information gathered from the data; sometimes in near real time, like suggested web search results, and sometimes with longer term human input, like many of the DRM case studies presented in this document. Over the past few decades, there has been an enormous increase incomputational capacity and speed and available sensor data, exponentially increasing the volume of available data for analysis. This has allowed the capabilities of ML algorithms to advance to nearly ubiquitous impact on many aspects of society. Machine learning and artificial intelligencehave become household terms, crossing from academia and specialized industry applications into everyday interactions with technology—from image, sound, and voice recognition features of our smartphones to seamlessly recommending items in online shopping, from mail sorting to ranking results of a search engine. The same technology is being leveraged to answer bigger questions in society, including questions about sustainable development, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management.",Machine Learning for Disaster Risk Management,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/503591547666118137/pdf/133787-WorldBank-DisasterRiskManagement-Ebook-D6.pdf,/research/2019/01/30764724/machine-learning-disaster-risk-management,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/503591547666118137/Machine-Learning-for-Disaster-Risk-Management,503591547666118137,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/503591547666118137/Machine-Learning-for-Disaster-Risk-Management,D30764724,51,,"Balog-Way,Simone Andrea Breunig",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key feature of solar electricity is that it is accessible in remote locations, thus providing development opportunities anywhere. While solar resources are fuel to solar power plants, the local geographical and climate conditions determine the efficiency of their operation. Free fuel makes solar technology attractive; however, effective investment and technical decisions require detailed, accurate and validated solar and meteorological data.

Lessons drawn form the project convey the following. 1) Embankment design must combine engineering solutions with appropriate plantation: the components supported by the project, including vegetative practices on the embankment slopes, and afforestation to reduce cyclone damage, and embankment maintenance costs, are good in physical, financial and social terms. The technically sound project interventions combined sustainable embankment maintenance practices, with gains in agricultural production, and farm incomes, setting the foundation of the project's success. 2) Need for a comprehensive approach in coastal zone management. future projects should assist the Government to prepare and implement a comprehensive development plan in line with their policy, to include: (a) coastal protection plan; (b) a network of safe havens; and, (c) a disaster preparedness, and response system. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) concept will be essential for ensuring sustainable development of the coastal zone, and, to this end, adequate attention and funding has to be provided to monitor the physical conditions of coastal embankments, and environmental and social impacts in the coastal areas. 3) Harmonization of donor policies and procedures: The difficulties, experienced in co-financing of technical assistance (TA), reflect lack of implementation readiness, and the need for harmonizing donor policies, and procedures for timely flow of funds. 4) Procurement reform is essential to improve public sector accountability: improper procurement practices found under the project, reinforce the importance of public sector procurement reform, fortunately, a public procurement reform project is now underway, to strictly follow the new procurement rules and standard bidding practices;

Following the May 1985 cyclone, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) formulated in 1986 a National Cyclone Protection Program (NCPP) with the objectives of minimizing disastrous effects of cyclones and storm surges. NCPP included plans for improving the coastal embankment system and introducing associated preventive measures. The objectives of PWP were to: (i) protect the agricultural areas within the polders against inundation by saline water; and (ii) provide protection against loss of human lives and damages caused by cyclonic storm surges. It should be noted that the Bank was prompt in responding to the request for emergency assistance from the Borrower, the quality of the physical works is good and the objectives of this assistance in terms of protection of human life and property and increased agricultural production are expected to have been substantially achieved. The outcome of the program is, therefore, rated as satisfactory. The main lessons learned are: 1) Design of engineering works under deadlines appropriate for emergency works increases the risk of under/over estimation of quantities and cost overruns; 2) Public opposition to the alignment of retired embankments was a significant factor in implementation delays; 3) Even under emergency procedures, land acquisition bottlenecks can cause significant implementation delays; 4) During the planning phase, beneficiaries need to be involved in deciding the provision of hydraulic structures; 5) Designs for improvement and/or repairs to existing structures should be done to minimize maintenance; 6) Contract management of major civil works by consultants is efficient and improved quality in civil works construction can be assured; 7) There is a need for GOB to review its procurement procedures to find ways to expedite decisions, particularly for emergency operations; 8) The implementation of the foreshore afforestation development under CERP should be given priority; and 9) When financing a project of significant size funded from several credits, an early decision should be made to prepare separate supervision reports for such projects.",Bangladesh - Coastal Embankment Rehabilitation & Reconstruction Project : Priority Works Programme (PWP),http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/544941468013808241/pdf/multi0page.pdf,/projects/documents/1996/09/734923/bangladesh-coastal-embankment-rehabilitation-reconstruction-project-priority-works-programme-pwp,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/544941468013808241/Bangladesh-Coastal-Embankment-Rehabilitation-Reconstruction-Project-Priority-Works-Programme-PWP,544941468013808241,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/544941468013808241/Bangladesh-Coastal-Embankment-Rehabilitation-Reconstruction-Project-Priority-Works-Programme-PWP,D734923,82,1996/09/734923/Bangladesh-Coastal-Embankment-Rehabilitation-Reconstruction-Project-Priority-Works-Programme-PWP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Flood protection,Other social services,Central Government (Central Agencies)",,,World,South Asia,Asia,,Afforestation; Community participation; Compensation; Embankments; Environmental monitoring; Improvement; Nongovernmental organizations; Polders; Project implementation; Resettlement; Technical assistance,,,,,

The GFCS aims to develop the capacity of countries to apply and generate climate information and products relevant to their particular concerns. Since many countries lack policies, institutions or human resources to enable them to take advantage of new or existing climate data and products or to establish a national dialogue on these issues, the capacity development component can be seen as a foundation that links and supports the other four pillars. The global framework for climate services is promoted and facilitated by the world meteorological organization (WMO) in cooperation with the GFCS partner advisory committee (PAC). Following the PAC’s identification of Moldova as a priority country, the World Bank as PAC member, together with the global facility for disaster reduction and recovery (GFDRR), volunteered to lead efforts in the country and has supported the conceptualisation and establishment of a national framework for climate services (NFCS) in Moldova.

This summary report aims to provide a knowledge base for policy and decision makers that will allow governments and sponsor organizations to understand the fundamental operations of weather, climate, and hydrological services (together constituting Hydromet services) and consequently target effective funding, in particular to developing countries. It summarizes two detailed and comprehensive supporting reports: (i) a background paper by the Japan Meteorological Business Support Center (JMBSC) on meteorological services; and (ii) a background paper by the Foundation of River and Basin Integrated Communications, Japan (FRICS), on hydrology and water resources. The Japanese model of hydromet services outlined in this summary report and the background papers is an excellent example of a modern service with strong government involvement and institutional governance built up over decades, comprehensive infrastructure, and sound and advanced service delivery. This paper is arranged as follows: (a) Section 2 explains the key historical phases of modernization of each service (as described in the background papers), which led to the current integrated modern service provided for the public good; and (b) Section 3, concludes with a synthesis of the key elements of the Japanese experience understood as a model for countries undertaking modernization, and discusses possible implications for developing countries.",Modernization of Japan’s hydromet services : a report on lessons learned for disaster risk management,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/338791494932249932/pdf/115069-WP-PUBLIC-Tokyo-Japan-Hydromet-Summary.pdf,/research/2017/01/27470257/modernization-japan’s-hydromet-services-report-lessons-learned-disaster-risk-management,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/338791494932249932/Modernization-of-Japan-s-hydromet-services-a-report-on-lessons-learned-for-disaster-risk-management,338791494932249932,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/338791494932249932/Modernization-of-Japan-s-hydromet-services-a-report-on-lessons-learned-for-disaster-risk-management,D27470257,28,2017/05/27470257/modernization-japan’s-hydromet-services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, weather risk events can cause losses in yield and production that translate into economic losses for producers, as well as other sector stakeholders that depend on income from agricultural trade, transport, processing, or export. This document is a guide for development practitioners and strategically presents a variety of mapping techniques for agricultural risk management and illustrates the application of these techniques for informing public and private sector development strategies. The introduction places weather risk mapping within the broader context of agricultural risk, explaining how mapping can enable risk identification, assessment and management activities, and each chapter elaborates on one or more of the technical components. A basic definition of agro-meteorology is provided, along with a discussion of different mapping techniques. The guide presents the available remote (satellite) databases of agro-meteorological variables that can be used for the purpose of weather risk mapping, assessing the advantages and drawbacks of each database and their suitability for different purposes. The document reviews current risk mapping analyses based on historical weather observations, which are typically used for risk identification and assessment, including climatologies, hazard and risk maps, climate regionalizations and agro-ecological zones (AEZ). The document also reviews forward-looking mapping techniques, known as diagnostic and forecasting analyses, specific examples of which are drawn from the United States, the European Union, and Australia. Finally, the guide provides instruction on how and why to conduct agro-ecological zoning, a technique that can be used to assess land-use types, land resources, land suitability, and climatic and agro-climatic regionalizations, as well as to inform land use recommendations.

The data used in this report is based on the Solargis model. The uncertainty of the solar resource data has been reduced by the regional model adaptation based on the ground measurements collected at six solar meteorological stations across Zambia, commissioned by The World Bank during the years 2015 to 2017 under the same activity. The ground-based solar resource measurements have been supplied by GeoSUN Africa, based in South Africa. The measurement campaign has been technically supported by SGS Inspection Services, Zambia. The report has two objectives is to explain the methodologies and outcomes of the solar resource and photovoltaic power potential assessment, based on the combined use of models and measured data. The report documents the uncertainty of solar and meteorological data, as key inputs in the technical and financial evaluation of solar energy systems and is to improve the awareness and knowledge of resources for solar energy technologies by producing a comprehensive countrywide dataset and maps based on the accuracy-enhanced models. The report evaluates key solar climate features, and the geographic and time variability of solar power potential in the country. The results of this report compare to interim solar resource validation at the beginning of the project, which were based on the Solargis model, validated by the ground measurements available in a wider region.

These solar meteorological stations were installed and operated by GeoSUN Africa (South Africa), under funding from the World Bank, over years 2016 to 2018. The accuracy-enhanced solar model makes it possible to calculate time series for any location with lower uncertainty. This effort results in more accurate regional data, which are needed in solar energy yield calculationand financial evaluation of an solar project to be developed in the region. The major benefit is higher confidence and lower costs of solar projects development. Used data layers represent long-term yearly and monthly averages of Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) and Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), and they cover a period of the last 24 years: from 1994 to 2017. The data is calculated by aggregation of sub-hourly map-based time series calculated for the territory of Malawi with 1-km spatial resolution. The aggregated data layers are delivered in the format that is compatible with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Additionally, printable maps are available in digital format and ready-to-use for large format printing. The accuracy of the data layers is enhanced by the regional adaptation of the Solargis model with use of ground measurements acquired at three high-standard solar meteorological stations located in Malawi. The measurements helped to reduce systematic deviation of the data inputs to the Solargis model as driving factors of the uncertainty in the region. Individual improvements of the Solargis model at the stations in Malawi are shown in the table below. Because of the Solargis model adaptation, the calculated GHI and DNI data are available with reduced uncertainty. The accuracy-enhanced solar model makes it possible to calculate more accurate time series and derived data products. This project reduced substantially the uncertainty of primary solar parameters that are key inputs in calculation of solar electricity yield and financial prediction. Thus results of this project increase confidence in the technical design and performance evaluation of any solar power plant in the region, and it also increases reliability of financial estimates.",Solar Resource and PV Potential of Malawi : Solar Model Validation Report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/480601547195733774/pdf/Solar-Resource-and-PV-Potential-of-Malawi-Solar-Model-Validation-Report.pdf,/research/2018/12/30753451/solar-resource-pv-potential-malawi-solar-model-validation-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/480601547195733774/Solar-Resource-and-PV-Potential-of-Malawi-Solar-Model-Validation-Report,480601547195733774,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/480601547195733774/Solar-Resource-and-PV-Potential-of-Malawi-Solar-Model-Validation-Report,D30753451,38,2018/12/30753451/solar-resource-pv-potential-malawi-solar-model-validation-report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Southern Africa,World,Sub-Saharan Africa,Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP),,,,,,

While no country in the world is safe from hydromet hazards, developing countries are affected the most, undermining sustainable economic growth. The needs are huge, and addressing them requires collaborative efforts of the public and private sectors and academia, which together form a network increasingly referred to as the Global Weather Enterprise. With these challenges in mind, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and the World Bank convened a special session where participants discussed opportunities and obstacles to achieving goals of the GWE.

In the context of South Asia, strengthening existing relationships and envisioning contexts for new relationships designed to address emerging challenges and opportunities will pave the way for mutual prosperity. Shared ecological habitats and natural resources presents a unique opportunity for cooperation and joint action. In the future, the regions’ dependence on shared natural resources such as forests, rivers and other ecological habitats will increase but so will be the threats these resources are exposed to. Preserving the ecological integrity of these resources that transcend sovereign borders through joint action is thus of critical importance in South Asia, for both human and national security. The fifth assessment report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) observes that projected sea-level rise in the Asian region is likely to result in significant losses of coastal eco-systems and that millions of people in South and South East Asia will be exposed to the risk of flooding. In the context of the Sundarban, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the government of India (GOI) and government of Bangladesh (GOB) on the conservation of the Sundarban was signed in September 2011 (MOU) in recognition of the potential of the Sundarban for sustaining ecological and human habitats. As per the provisions of the MOU, both the Indian and Bangladesh governments agreed to adopt appropriate joint management and monitoring of resources, promote joint research to develop a understanding of the impacts of climate change along with adaptation strategies, foster information exchange programmes, effective patrolling in respective border areas and promote capacity building.",Vision for the Sundarban Region,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/223551587113768145/pdf/Vision-for-the-Sundarban-Region.pdf,/research/2017/10/31955641/vision-sundarban-region,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/223551587113768145/Vision-for-the-Sundarban-Region,223551587113768145,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/223551587113768145/Vision-for-the-Sundarban-Region,D31955641,57,2017/10/31955641/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Irrigation and Drainage,Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management,Water Supply,Ports/Waterways,Other Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","Rural services and infrastructure,Other environment and natural resources management,Water resource management,Climate change","Rural development,Environment and natural resource management",,,,,,,,,,

Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are susceptible to natural hazards such as tropical cyclones, flooding, tidal surges, droughts, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis, which can result in disasters that affect their entire economic, human, and physical environment and impact their long-term development agenda. Climate change projections suggest that the Pacific will face an even greater intensity of weather and climate-related hazard events in the coming years, making PICs among the most physically vulnerable nations in the world. The social and economic losses as a result of extreme events, paired with high population growth and rapid urbanization of the region, are likely to contribute to more people being affected by disasters and climate change. Hence, there is widespread acceptance of the need to strengthen disaster early warning and preparedness, and to mainstream disaster risk and climate change into development planning and financing.",Marshall Islands - Pacific Resilience Program Project : environmental assessment : Regional environmental and social management framework,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/687571468271514131/pdf/E47990EAP0ESMF0Box391418B00PUBLIC0.pdf,/projects/documents/2015/02/24321678/marshall-islands-pacific-resilience-program-project-environmental-assessment-regional-environmental-social-management-framework,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/687571468271514131/Regional-environmental-and-social-management-framework,687571468271514131,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/687571468271514131/Regional-environmental-and-social-management-framework,D24321678,143,2015/02/24321678/marshall-islands-pacific-resilience-program-project-environmental-assessment-regional-environmental-social-management-framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"General finance sector,Public administration - Water, sanitation and flood protection","Climate change,Natural disaster management","Environment and natural resource management,Social protection and risk management",World,Oceania,,,,,,,,

The country’s location and topography make it vulnerable to tropical cyclones, tsunamis, storm surge, extreme rainfall, flooding, landslides, rockslides and forest fires. These adverse effects are further exacerbated by the medium to long-term effects of climate change and present significant risks to the country’s sustainable development. On 17 and 19 April 2016, Farquhar Atoll, located in the Seychelles’ Outer Islands, was hit by the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded to have developed over the Indian Ocean basin. Tropical Cyclone Fantala was the sixth cyclone occurring during the 2015-2016 tropical cyclone season, making landfalls twice on Farquhar Atoll, damaging almost all the infrastructure and coconut palm tree groves on the atoll. Given the recognized global importance of the Farquhar Atoll’s natural ecosystems, a separate chapter is dedicated to the cyclone impacts on the environment, with detailed descriptions of impacts on natural habitats, vegetation, and fauna, is included in this report.",Seychelles post disaster needs assessment : tropical cyclone Fantala April 2016,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/802481498125766383/pdf/116521-WP-Seychelles-Fantala-Final-Publish-Version-PUBLIC.pdf,/research/2016/04/27667190/seychelles-post-disaster-needs-assessment-tropical-cyclone-fantala-april-2016,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/802481498125766383/Seychelles-post-disaster-needs-assessment-tropical-cyclone-Fantala-April-2016,802481498125766383,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/802481498125766383/Seychelles-post-disaster-needs-assessment-tropical-cyclone-Fantala-April-2016,D27667190,72,2017/06/27667190/seychelles-post-disaster-needs-assessment-tropical-cyclone-fantala-april-2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,Middle East and North Africa,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,

It passednear Farquhar Atoll on April 17, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 241 km/h. On April 19, itsustained maximum wind speeds of 157 km/h, causing widespread damage. Tropical cyclone Fantalamade landfall on the evening of Sunday 17 with winds up to 350 km/h. Significant damage was reportedon Farquhar Island's environment, physical infrastructure, and coconut palm tree groves. On April 20,the Government of Seychelles declared the Farquhar group area, including Providence Atoll and St.Pierre a disaster area. The report provides a breakdown of key sectors affected, the economic damages and losses,as well as the resources needed to finance the recovery of the areas negatively impacted upon by thepassing of Tropical Cyclone Fantala over Farquhar Atoll. The PDNA report also provides recommendations and guidelines to ensure that a risk reduction perspective that incorporates a build back-better approach guides the recovery process. The aim is to mitigate the underlying drivers of vulnerability. A key outcome of the PDNA assessment is to highlight an enhanced understanding that disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation considerations shall be the overarching themes that underpin the selection of sustainable recovery interventions, contributing to protect the country’s social and economic gains and assets, as well as its natural environment and ecosystem services. The PDNA is a methodology for joint assessment and recovery planning that seeks to assess the impact of the disaster and define a strategy for recovery, including the estimation of financial resources required. The assessment evaluates the disaster effects, pulling together information on the physical damages of the disaster and on its socio economic aspects (economic losses, changes in service delivery and governance caused by the disasters, and increased risks and vulnerabilities). On these bases, it evaluates the overallimpact of the disaster on the macro-economic and human development context of a country. Based on this information, the PDNA determines the needs and recovery priorities generated by the disaster and produces a consolidated report that lends to a resilient recovery strategy.",Seychelles post disaster needs assessment : tropical cyclone fantala : A report by the Government of Seychelles,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/767291481886997139/pdf/111075-WP-P151462-PUBLIC-SeychellesFantalaPDNAFinal.pdf,/research/2016/04/27029554/seychelles-post-disaster-needs-assessment-tropical-cyclone-fantala-report-government-seychelles,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/767291481886997139/A-report-by-the-Government-of-Seychelles,767291481886997139,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/767291481886997139/A-report-by-the-Government-of-Seychelles,D27029554,72,2017/06/27029554/seychelles-post-disaster-needs-assessment-tropical-cyclone-fantala-report-government-seychelles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other Transportation,Other Public Administration,Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management","Climate change,Natural disaster management","Environment and natural resource management,Social protection and risk management",World,Middle East and North Africa,Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,

This component includes four subcomponents: institutional component, Ayeyarwady River Basin Master Plan and Decision Support System, Preparation of Future Investments (PFI), and implementation support. The second component is the hydro-meteorological observation and information systems modernization. This component includes three subcomponents: institutional and regulatory strengthening, capacity building and implementation support, modernization of observation infrastructure, data management systems and forecasting, and enhancement of Hydromet service delivery systems. The third component is the navigation enhancement on the Ayeyarwady River. This component includes four subcomponents: navigation Improvements, navigation aids, water quality monitoring, and institutional strengthening and implementation support. Finally, the fourth component is the contingent emergency response. This ‘zero component’ (initially without any allocated funding) will allow for the rapid reallocation of funds from other components to provide emergency recovery and reconstruction support in the event of a natural disaster, emergency and/or catastrophic event. Funds potentially reallocated to component four will be disbursed either against a positive list of critical goods and/or against the procurement of works, and consultant services required to support the immediate response and recovery needs of the GoM. A contingent emergency response implementation plan will be developed to guide financial management, procurement, safeguard and any other necessary implementation arrangements and procedures.",Myanmar - Ayeyarwady Integrated River Basin Management Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/347681468279901640/pdf/PAD9870PAD0P14010Box385366B00OUO090.pdf,/projects/documents/2014/11/20394428/myanmar-ayeyarwady-integrated-river-basin-management-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/347681468279901640/Myanmar-Ayeyarwady-Integrated-River-Basin-Management-Project,347681468279901640,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/347681468279901640/Myanmar-Ayeyarwady-Integrated-River-Basin-Management-Project,D20394428,97,2014/11/20394428/myanmar-ayeyarwady-integrated-river-basin-management-project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Public Administration - Water, Sanitation and Waste Management,Other Public Administration,Ports/Waterways,Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management,Other Transportation","Environmental policies and institutions,Water resource management,Natural disaster management,Rural policies and institutions","Rural development,Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management",East Asia and Pacific,World,Asia,,,,,,,

To leverage new investment, generate knowledge and expertise, and build a global partnership for disaster risk management (DRM), the global facility for disaster reduction and recovery (GFDRR) was established in 2006. As a World Bank-hosted facility, GFDRR provides grant financing and offers a range of analytical and advisory services that are directly impacting on the ability of high-risk, low income countries to understand and act on the hazards they face, helping them adapt to a changing climate.",Disaster risk management : building a safe and resilient future for all,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/312541468133192492/pdf/918910BRI0Box30DRM0Sep201100Public0.pdf,/research/2011/09/23169313/disaster-risk-management-building-safe-resilient-future-all,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/312541468133192492/Disaster-risk-management-building-a-safe-and-resilient-future-for-all,312541468133192492,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/312541468133192492/Disaster-risk-management-building-a-safe-and-resilient-future-for-all,D23169313,6,2011/09/23169313/disaster-risk-management-building-safe-resilient-future-all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IBRD results,,,,,,

Nowhere is this need more acutely felt than in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The four environmental risks all have a higher-than-average likelihood of occurrence and are tangibly affecting human well-being, including health and economic prosperity. How can these environmental risks be reduced, and losses avoided? Because weather, climate, and the water cycle know no national boundaries, international cooperation is essential for people and society to get timely access to high quality and actionable information to mitigate the threat of meteorological and hydrological hazards. This international cooperation takes place in what is called the Global Weather Enterprise (GWE), a term coined to describe the totality of activities by individuals and organizations to enable weather information to be created and provided to society. The GWE is a supreme exemplar of the value of international cooperation, public-private management, and scientific technological know-how. This report is arranged as follows: Chapter 1 examines the current state of the GWE, the need for modernizing National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs), and the difficulties of sustaining improvements once they occur; Chapter 2 takes an in-depth look at NMHSs, highlighting the unacceptably big gap between the capabilities of the most and least advanced ones; Chapter 3 examines why NMHSs need to focus more on providing the services that their stakeholders need and want; and Chapter 4 provides detailed recommendations for modernizing NMHSs.",Weathering the Change : How to Improve Hydromet Services in Developing Countries?,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/812651554460935056/pdf/Weathering-the-Change-How-to-Improve-Hydromet-Services-in-Developing-Countries.pdf,/research/2019/01/30961344/weathering-change-improve-hydromet-services-developing-countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/812651554460935056/Weathering-the-Change-How-to-Improve-Hydromet-Services-in-Developing-Countries,812651554460935056,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/812651554460935056/Weathering-the-Change-How-to-Improve-Hydromet-Services-in-Developing-Countries,D30961344,112,2019/01/30961344/weathering-change-improve-hydromet-services-developing-countries,"Kull,Daniel Werner","Bogdanova,Anna-Maria","Suwa,Makoto",,,,,,,,,,,"Renewable Energy Hydro,Other Public Administration,Agricultural Extension, Research, and Other Support Activities,Aviation,Public Administration - Water, Sanitation and Waste Management","Climate change,Natural disaster management,Pollution management and environmental health,Water resource management","Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management",,,,,,,,,,

The tool is in its first phase of development (2020-2021) and has been road-tested in selected countries, including the Kyrgyz Republic. MeteoSwiss was tasked by WMO to carry out the road-testing of the tool by peer-reviewing Kyrgyzhydromet services. The peer-review was facilitated by the World Bank and financed by the Central Asia Water and Energy Program (CAWEP). The Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked country in Central Asia, with a surface of 199,951 km and a population of approximately 6’590’000 people. As Switzerland, the Kyrgyz Republic has a predominantly mountainous terrain. The country’s climate is continental with significant local variations, particularly according to differences in elevation. Kyrgyzhydromet is the agency for hydrometeorology under the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Kyrgyz Republic. It was established in 1926. The Kyrgyz Republic is a member of the World Meteorological Organization since 1994. Its main tasks are: a) Providing the government of the Kyrgyz Republic, the population and various sectors of the economy with hydrometeorological information as well as information about pollution of the natural environment. b) Issuing warnings of natural and dangerous hydrometeorological phenomena, such as avalanches, mudflows, floods, storm winds, heavy precipitation, etc. and communicating them to the population, relevant structures of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, interested ministries and agencies. c) Making and issuing forecasts for weather, water availability of rivers, crop yields, phenological forecasts. d) Providing analysis of hydrometeorological conditions and information on pollution of the natural environment, as well as gathering publications of scientific and applied reference books. e) Maintaining a database on the state of the natural environment.",Country Hydromet Diagnostic : Kyrgyzhydromet Peer Review Report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/201341626098692283/pdf/Country-Hydromet-Diagnostic-Kyrgyzhydromet-Peer-Review-Report.pdf,/research/2021/04/33261260/country-hydromet-diagnostic-kyrgyzhydromet-peer-review-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/201341626098692283/Country-Hydromet-Diagnostic-Kyrgyzhydromet-Peer-Review-Report,201341626098692283,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/201341626098692283/Country-Hydromet-Diagnostic-Kyrgyzhydromet-Peer-Review-Report,D33261260,29,,"Lukasczyk,Christian","Pache,Alicia","Rossa,Andrea","Roulet,Yves-Alain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This results in a lack of actionable, early warning information that would allow for proper droughtpreparations to be activated. For example, there have been several recent cases in the Pacific region where communities have run out of potable drinking water during drought events, endangering lives and hampering recovery efforts. This has also meant that ad-hoc emergency supplies have had to be urgently organized, resulting in higher expenses and increased risk for citizens. A team at New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) focused on working with national meteorological services in three Pacific countries – Fiji, Solomon Islands, andSamoa to provide open source drought risk monitoring and visualization tools to help overcome thischallenge. The goal was to provide climate services staff with the ability to be able to quickly generate improved drought information and policy input for national disaster management agencies and other partners, and to support the development and implementation of Drought Response Plans.",Challenge fund projects : National institute of water and atmospheric research,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/191681497436059461/pdf/116247-BRI-PUBLIC-ADD-SERIES-NIWA-Challenge-Fund-Project.pdf,/research/2017/05/27580509/challenge-fund-projects-national-institute-water-atmospheric-research,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/191681497436059461/Challenge-fund-projects-National-institute-of-water-and-atmospheric-research,191681497436059461,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/191681497436059461/Challenge-fund-projects-National-institute-of-water-and-atmospheric-research,D27580509,2,2017/06/27580509/challenge-fund-projects-national-institute-water-atmospheric-research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Challenge fund projects -National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Reseach (NIWA),,,,,,

The authors selected 184 major disasters in terms of the size of economic damages, based on the data available from the International Emergency Disasters and MunichRe (NatCat) databases for natural catastrophes. They estimate the losses and total impacts including the higher-order effects of these disasters using social accounting matrices constructed for this study. Although the aggregate damages based on the data amount to US$742 billion, the aggregate losses and total impacts are estimated at US$360 billion and US$678 billion, respectively. The results show a growing trend of economic impacts over time in absolute value. However, once the data and estimates are normalized using global gross domestic product, the historical trend of total impacts becomes statistically insignificant. The visual observation confirms the inverted U curve distribution between total impact and income level, while statistical analyses indicate negative linear relationships between them for climatological, geophysical, and especially hydrological events.",Impact estimation of disasters : a global aggregate for 1960 to 2007,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/787121468340170531/pdf/WPS4963.pdf,/research/2009/06/10690399/impact-estimation-disasters-global-aggregate-1960-2007,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/787121468340170531/Impact-estimation-of-disasters-a-global-aggregate-for-1960-to-2007,787121468340170531,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/787121468340170531/Impact-estimation-of-disasters-a-global-aggregate-for-1960-to-2007,D10690399,42,2009/06/10690399/Impact-estimation-of-disasters-a-global-aggregate-for-1960-to-2007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Policy Research working paper ; no.

Some of the negative impacts and mitigation measures include: erosion and sediment transport down the Nam Kor River can also be a moderate impact during Project construction as most of the construction will be made during dry season. The removal of vegetation and earthworks on the riverbanks and in-stream works will detach sand, silt, and clay which will be suspended in the water column for eventual deposition downstream in areas where water velocity slows with the finer fraction likely flowing the length of the lower Nam Kor River and discharged to downstream areas during the rainy season. Nam Kor River will be turbid during the construction phase downstream of the Project areas until river improvement works completed and following vegetation has re-established riverbanks and the riverbed substrate has stabilized. Observation suggested that during dry season, the water in Nam Kor and Nam Mao River in Muang Xay is very shallow with high turbidity and with waste (solid and liquid) discharge from urban sources, and there are local water plants and river garden in some areas; to respect the cultural sites as well as cultural norm and traditional practice, ensure security and privacy of women and households in close proximity to the camps and the use of asbestos containing materials is not allowed; and to conduct daily monitoring and inspection of construction activities to ensure environmental and social impacts are managed and mitigated appropriately in local communities. These potential impacts include wastes, discharge, dust, community health and safety, OCHS, construction waste contaminated on private land, social issues and social security, etc.","Lao PDR - Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Management Project : Environmental and Social Management Plan - Main Report for Component One Integrated Urban Flood Risk Management in Muang Xay, Oudomxay ODX Province",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099825005312233408/pdf/P16093006e12ce060b6c803de0fa784fd4.pdf,/projects/documents/2022/03/33832958/lao-pdr-southeast-asia-disaster-risk-management-project-environmental-social-management-plan-main-report-component-one-integrated-urban-flood-risk-management-muang-xay-oudomxay-odx-province,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099825005312233408/P16093006e12ce060b6c803de0fa784fd4,099825005312233408,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099825005312233408/P16093006e12ce060b6c803de0fa784fd4,D33832958,94,2022/03/33832958/P16093006e12ce060b6c803de0fa784fd4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ICT Services,Public Administration - Water, Sanitation and Waste Management,Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management",,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to significant development challenges, Yemen is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Rainfall is erratic and variable, a situation made worse by high evapotranspiration rates. Sustainable social and economic development in Yemen depends on knowledge of climate variability and change, and reliable and actionable meteorological and hydrological forecasts and warnings. Upgrading weather, climate and water information will reduce vulnerabilities to natural hazards and increase food and water security. Yemen is particularly reliant on its natural resources outside the extractive industries. Agriculture plays a leading role in Yemen's economy and employs more than half of the labor force. Through the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR), Yemen aims to better manage water resources, increasing agricultural productivity and reducing the risk of climate-sensitive diseases. This will be done by improving the monitoring and assessment of climate variability and change and providing targeted and reliable information for decision making.",Improving the reliability of weather and climate services in Yemen,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/717761468339548243/pdf/802510BRI0clim0Box0379802B00PUBLIC0.pdf,/research/2013/07/18108087/improving-reliability-weather-climate-services-yemen,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/717761468339548243/Improving-the-reliability-of-weather-and-climate-services-in-Yemen,717761468339548243,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/717761468339548243/Improving-the-reliability-of-weather-and-climate-services-in-Yemen,D18108087,4,2013/07/18108087/improving-reliability-weather-climate-services-yemen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,Middle East and North Africa,,MENA knowledge and learning quick notes series ; no. 102,,,,,,

Although most of the work happens at the national and sub-national level, regional cooperation is key for prospective advancement of building guidance strategies based on international best practices. Climate services are the core of regional development in forecasting and service delivery. At the center of developing effective climate services is the ability to translate climate into actionable guidance for decision support cutting across various sectors. South Asia Hydromet Forum (SAHF) works to reinforce national activities leading to a more sustainable program of rendering state of the art meteorological and hydrological services throughout the region. SAHF aims to identify specific fit-for-purpose investments towards building technical and intellectual capacity of Nation Meteorological and Hydrological Services to respond to the main users’ needs through overall skill development of the service professionals in the region in line with global standards. SAHF III expanded on SAHF I & II by largely focusing on service delivery, regional collaboration, and innovation, through adoption of a climate/early warning information value chain approach. SAHF III brought together a wide range of user and stakeholder institutions that connect NMHSs with the societal systems, climate sensitive sectors of the economy, academic and private institutions. SAHF III discussed challenges faced by the region to evolve and adopt collaborative regional strategies for enhanced use of observations, open data accessibility, sustainability of observation systems, ensemble predictions, impact-based forecasting (IBF) systems and user-oriented advisory & decision support services. In order to meet the explosive growth in demand for weather and climate data products and services, SAHF III resolved to dramatically strengthen the South Asia overall extreme weather and climate services through a systematic increase in expansion of critical observing system networks and rapid exchange of observational data and forecast products by establishing a robust regional Data Exchange mechanism. Further, SAHF III resolved to set-up a South Asia Consortium for data and weather Predictions (SCOPE), to serve as a regional collaborative mechanism that blends both cutting-edge technological advances and conventional techniques potentially enabled by SAHF regional cloud computing, storage, and networking services infrastructure with investment by pooling of resources. All efforts in this endeavor will be through leveraging significant commitment from institutions and partners of the region. SAHF III has worked out specific targets and action plans for implementation.",South Asia Hydromet Forum Annual Session 2021 : Summary Report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099060223163531960/pdf/P171154033c53c0c10822f057569de487b3.pdf,/research/2022/01/34074669/south-asia-hydromet-forum-annual-session-2021-summary-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099060223163531960/P171154033c53c0c10822f057569de487b3,099060223163531960,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099060223163531960/P171154033c53c0c10822f057569de487b3,D34074669,37,2022/01/34074669/P171154033c53c0c10822f057569de487b3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other Public Administration,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interim mesoscale modelling results were calculated by output from simulations of the weather, research, and forecasting (WRF) model. The authors document the method used to run the mesoscale simulations and to generalize the WRF model wind climatologies. A preliminary validation is described. A meteorological phenomena of particular interest is the nocturnal low level jet and this is examined in the model output data. Finally recommendations for the next steps in the project are stated. This report is structured as follows: section one gives introduction. Sections two and three describe the general method and the specific modelling setup of the WRF modelling systems used in the generation of the Vietnam phase one output. Section four presents results. In section five a preliminary validation of the interim modelling results against observations is presented. Section six presents an analysis of nocturnal low level jets, which is a wind energy relevant phenomena seen in the WRF simulations. Section seven sets out a number of points of discussion and recommendation for how the modelling will be advanced in the next phase of the project, as well as recommendations for the project in general. Finally, section eight presents some conclusions.",Wind resource mapping in Vietnam : mesoscale modelling report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/264301468115480511/pdf/958020ESM00P140eling0Report02014008.pdf,/research/2015/02/24382515/wind-resource-mapping-vietnam-mesoscale-modelling-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/264301468115480511/Wind-resource-mapping-in-Vietnam-mesoscale-modelling-report,264301468115480511,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/264301468115480511/Wind-resource-mapping-in-Vietnam-mesoscale-modelling-report,D24382515,46,2015/02/24382515/wind-resource-mapping-vietnam-mesoscale-modelling-report,"Volker, Patrick J.

The effectiveness of early warning systems designed to reduce exposure to hazards depends on people’s capacity to understand and respond to a given situation. This remains a challenge in most countries and is a high priority in PICs, where early action is essential to save lives and to protect livelihoods and property. A common approach to multi-hazard early warning systems (MHEWSs) has been advocated by national meteorological services (NMSs), which are primarily responsible for forecasts and warnings of weather, climate, and geo-hazards. MHEWS inform the people of the potential impacts of impending natural hazards, the risks on their lives and livelihoods, and the action they should take. To be effective, this approach entails multistakeholder cooperation and coordination between and among national science, disaster risk management agencies, and other relevant stakeholders. The aim of this assessment is to validate the gaps, which have been identified in the capacity of these agencies and other stakeholders to minimize the adverse impacts of meteorological, hydrological, and geophysical hazards (hereafter, natural hazards), which can result in disasters that affect their entire economic, human, and physical environment and impact the long-term development agenda of Samoa.",Early Warning System Needs Assessment and Investment Plan for the Pacific Islands : Samoa,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/983251584942847169/pdf/Early-Warning-System-Needs-Assessment-and-Investment-Plan-for-the-Pacific-Islands-Samoa.pdf,/research/2020/01/31884321/early-warning-system-needs-assessment-investment-plan-pacific-islands-samoa,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/983251584942847169/Early-Warning-System-Needs-Assessment-and-Investment-Plan-for-the-Pacific-Islands-Samoa,983251584942847169,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/983251584942847169/Early-Warning-System-Needs-Assessment-and-Investment-Plan-for-the-Pacific-Islands-Samoa,D31884321,20,2020/01/31884321/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study uses monthly nightlight composites in conjunction with a wind field model to econometrically estimate the impact of tropical cyclones on local economic activity in the Dominican Republic since 1992. It is found that the negative impact of storms lasts up to 15 months after the strike, with the largest effect observed after nine months. Translating the reduction in nightlight intensity into monetary losses by relating it to quarterly gross domestic product suggests that on average the storms reduced gross domestic product by about US$1.1 billion (4.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2000 and 1.5 percent in 2016).",The impact of hurricane strikes on short-term local economic activity : evidence from nightlight images in the Dominican Republic,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/482101513260134821/pdf/WPS8275.pdf,/research/2017/12/29269193/impact-hurricane-strikes-short-term-local-economic-activity-evidence-nightlight-images-dominican-republic,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/482101513260134821/The-impact-of-hurricane-strikes-on-short-term-local-economic-activity-evidence-from-nightlight-images-in-the-Dominican-Republic,482101513260134821,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/482101513260134821/The-impact-of-hurricane-strikes-on-short-term-local-economic-activity-evidence-from-nightlight-images-in-the-Dominican-Republic,D29269193,28,2017/12/29269193/The-impact-of-hurricane-strikes-on-short-term-local-economic-activity-evidence-from-nightlight-images-in-the-Dominican-Republic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Latin America & Caribbean,World,Caribbean,"Policy Research working paper,no.

The subcomponents will include: (i) remedial works for 32 high risk dams; (ii) provision of basic safety facilities for 80 large dams; (iii) training for strengthening dam-owning organizations; and (iv) studies and supply of specialized equipment. The second is the hydro meteorological information system improvement component. This component will enhance institutional capacity and physical and analytical infrastructure for monitoring hydro-meteorological data, detecting and forecasting water hazards, and water resources planning and management. The third is the multi-sectoral water resources planning component. This component will improve institutional capacity for integrated and multi-sectoral water resources planning and assist in selection and prioritization of water resources development investments.

This effect is described here as a new generation of water-related projects, a type that the Bank is increasingly asked to consider. These projects aim to enhance a country's capacity to collect, process, and use the most critically important input to the process of water management: information. Thus, the goal of achieving substantive improvements in water-use efficiency and the improvement of water quality presupposes such detailed knowledge as how water is presently used, conditions of water supply, accurate and timely forecasts of meteorological events, alternative institutions for water management, and conditions requisite for their effective operation. The Bank's new generation of water-related projects creates the need for a new generation of evaluation procedures and methods. The present study explores three approaches -the inferential approach, the anecdotal approach, and the minimum impact approach that might be used to evaluate such projects, using the Mexico Water Resources Management Project (WRMP) as the expository vehicle. The WRMP is detailed and then evaluated by applying the three approaches.",New evaluation procedures for a new generation of water-related projects,,/research/1996/12/695071/new-evaluation-procedures-new-generation-water-related-projects,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/897731468757220773/New-evaluation-procedures-for-a-new-generation-of-water-related-projects,897731468757220773,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/897731468757220773/New-evaluation-procedures-for-a-new-generation-of-water-related-projects,D695071,,1996/12/695071/new-evaluation-procedures-new-generation-water-related-projects,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISBN 0-8213-3829-3,(Historic)Other water supply and sanitation,,,World,North America,Latin America & Caribbean,World Bank technical paper ; no.

The report seeks to address the risk and exposure of less developed countries in the region and strengthen their capacity to predict and prepare for disasters, and thus improve resilience and reduce risk and subsequent losses. The core of the proposed initiative is the development of an open risk modelling framework. The Open Risk Modelling System (ORMS) is expected to be used in national planning, in disaster preparedness and emergency management by all stakeholders. Regional and national capacity building in risk management is another purpose of the initiative, and by insurance and financial institutions involved in reducing the impacts of disaster risks. Regional and national capacity building in risk management is another purpose of the initiative. The proposed ORMS will serve as a decision support tool to foster cooperation in water related disaster risk management in the Mekong Region. The key components the ORMS are: data management system; data sharing platform; hazard, vulnerability and risk modelling framework; and web based dissemination platform. In addition to the system definition and framework development, the report also deals with the improvement of hydro-meteorological monitoring network and development of specific flood and drought risk models with focus on Lao PDR and Cambodia. The efforts include development of reliable hazard models and population of database with exposure and vulnerability data which form the basis of operational risk models.",Disaster risk management in the lower Mekong basin : Development of an open risk modelling framework,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/467721468279844030/pdf/686440ESW0P1210kong0Basin0April2011.pdf,/research/2011/03/16278100/disaster-risk-management-lower-mekong-basin-development-open-risk-modelling-framework,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/467721468279844030/Disaster-risk-management-in-the-lower-Mekong-basin-Development-of-an-open-risk-modelling-framework,467721468279844030,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/467721468279844030/Disaster-risk-management-in-the-lower-Mekong-basin-Development-of-an-open-risk-modelling-framework,D16278100,19,2011/03/16278100/disaster-risk-management-lower-mekong-basin-development-open-risk-modelling-framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information technology,General finance sector,Non-compulsory health finance",Natural disaster management,Social protection and risk management,,,,,,,,,,

Inadequate early warning systems (EWSs), coupled with limited investment and weak institutional and technical capacity, are implicated in contributing to food insecurity–related emergencies in ESA. Yet over the years, strong evidence has emerged on the benefits of investing in EWSs. In Ethiopia, investing in a drought EWS, which would reduce livelihood losses and dependence on assistance, has a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of between 3:1 and 6:1. Similarly, the BCR of improving national hydro-meteorological services in developing countries ranges from 4:1 to 36:1. Consistent with one of the goals of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), increasing investment in EWSs would contribute to a substantial increase in the availability of, and access to multi hazard and disaster risk information, one of the key inputs in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs).",Assessment of food security early warning systems for East and Southern Africa,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/454781516290787924/pdf/122857-ESW-P161298-PUBLIC.pdf,/research/2018/01/29517801/assessment-food-security-early-warning-systems-east-southern-africa,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/454781516290787924/Assessment-of-food-security-early-warning-systems-for-East-and-Southern-Africa,454781516290787924,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/454781516290787924/Assessment-of-food-security-early-warning-systems-for-East-and-Southern-Africa,D29517801,142,2018/01/29517801/assessment-food-security-early-warning-systems-east-southern-africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry,Livestock,Agricultural Extension, Research, and Other Support Activities,Fisheries,Crops","Natural disaster management,Nutrition and food security,Global food crisis response,Climate change","Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management,Rural development,Human development",,,,Africa Climate Business Plan Series,,,,,,

Key environmental impacts resulting from the project include noise, dust, and waste water during the construction phase of the heat supply plant. During the operational phase, dust, smoke, sulfur dioxide, ash and noise etc from hot water boilers will have a negative impact. In the construction stage of the pipeline network/ heat exchange station project, key environmental issues will be noise from heat exchange station construction, dust, waste water, domestic and building wastes; noise, dust and traffic interruptions resulting from pipeline network construction. In the operating period of this project there will be noise from heat exchange station. During the construction phase of the gas supply project, key environmental issues will be construction noise of gas supply factory, dust, building waste water, domestic and building wastes; noise, dust and traffic interruptions resulted from pipeline network construction, while in the operating period negative impacts include pollutants emitted from boilers of gas supply plant, waste water and noise.

Limitations with the data are related to restrictions in weather station coverage (density), and problems with the quality (errors and gaps in the information) and availability of historical records. This paper evaluates the reconstruction of historical meteorological records with gridded datasets for Honduras and Guatemala1 using the methodology in Uribe Alcantara et al. (2009).The reconstruction with synthetic series is implemented by replacing missing observations with estimations from regular grids (or gridded analyses). The development of synthetic series proposed here will facilitate, among other potential uses, the implementation of risk analysis in insurance contracts where meteorological information is limited or incomplete. This paper is organized in four sections. Section one describes the conceptual approach and methods implemented for the evaluation of the data and the development of the gridded analysis. Section two describes the results of the implementation of the gridded analysis for Honduras and Guatemala. Section three provides a brief description of possible applications of the regular grids for the development of weather insurance contracts. Section four summarizes the main conclusions.",Weather data grids for agriculture risk management : the case of Honduras and Guatemala,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/583801468037498415/pdf/777800WP0Box370or0agrisk0management.pdf,/research/2013/01/17731954/weather-data-grids-agriculture-risk-management-case-honduras-guatemala,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/583801468037498415/Weather-data-grids-for-agriculture-risk-management-the-case-of-Honduras-and-Guatemala,583801468037498415,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/583801468037498415/Weather-data-grids-for-agriculture-risk-management-the-case-of-Honduras-and-Guatemala,D17731954,44,2013/01/17731954/weather-data-grids-agriculture-risk-management-case-honduras-guatemala,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,Latin America & Caribbean,Central America,,,,,,,

Existing observations indicate that the temperature is rising at a higher rate in Nepal and Chinese regions of the Himalayas compared with rest of the Himalayas. A declining trend of monsoon in the western Indian Himalayas and an increasing trend in the eastern Indian Himalayas have been observed, whereas increasing precipitation and stream flow in many parts of Tibetan Plateau are noted. Glaciers in both the eastern and western Himalayas are mostly retreating, but the majority of the glaciers in Karakorum are either stable or advancing slowly. Expansion of glacier lakes is reported, with the highest rate in Nepal and Bhutan. Most literature predicts increases in temperature and monsoon precipitations and decreases in winter precipitations in the future thereby leading to monsoon flooding and increased sediments in stream flow. Available hydrological simulations indicate reduced rainfall and shrinkage of glacier thereby leading to shortage of water supply for power generation and irrigation in winter particularly in highly glaciated basins. Projected economic impacts of glacial lake outburst floods can be substantial on the developed river basin with infrastructures and population centers. However, there is a clear gap in knowledge of economic impacts of climate change in the Himalayas.",Climate change in the Himalayas : current state of knowledge,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/421301468350108330/pdf/WPS6516.pdf,/research/2013/06/17935389/climate-change-himalayas-current-state-knowledge,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/421301468350108330/Climate-change-in-the-Himalayas-current-state-of-knowledge,421301468350108330,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/421301468350108330/Climate-change-in-the-Himalayas-current-state-of-knowledge,D17935389,64,2013/06/17935389/Climate-change-in-the-Himalayas-current-state-of-knowledge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,Asia,East Asia and Pacific,Policy Research working paper ; no.

The regional priority on climate change adaptation highlights an adaptation mechanism that has emerged with broad support: upgrade and dissemination of spatially-resolved, accurate weather forecasts and robust mechanisms to place this information in the hands of farmers on a timely basis. The objective of this innovation grant-funded activity was to bring Europe and Central Asia (ECA) staff up to date on the emerging good practice in Turkey, providing an opportunity for staff working on the Central Asia portfolio to discuss with Turkish experts and colleagues how the model could be applied in Central Asia. A second phase of the activity will address the issue that, while Turkey generates its own high-resolution weather forecasts, the bank's Central Asian clients do not. The activity therefore set out to identify practical options and methods to adapt the Turkish good practice by using publicly available forecasts from international sources. The applicability of such global forecasts to the purpose of providing weather alerts to farmers in Central Asia will be reviewed and tested in the field.",New uses for global forecasts : FY10 ECA innovation grant - final report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/471411468302430477/pdf/688070ESW0P1190casts00Final0Report.pdf,/research/2010/01/16281979/new-uses-global-forecasts-fy10-eca-innovation-grant-final-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/471411468302430477/New-uses-for-global-forecasts-FY10-ECA-innovation-grant-final-report,471411468302430477,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/471411468302430477/New-uses-for-global-forecasts-FY10-ECA-innovation-grant-final-report,D16281979,15,2010/01/16281979/new-uses-global-forecasts-fy10-eca-innovation-grant-final-report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,Asia,Central Asia,,,Commonwealth of Independent States,Eastern Europe,,,

The analysis identifies gaps and challenges in producing and delivering weather,climate and hydrological information and services, and it lays out a technical strategic framework for policy- and decision-makers in the Ministry of Emergency Situations and the larger Armenian government. Specifically, the Road Map posits three scenarios for modernizing the AHS based on the potential cost and benefits of each while aiming for a greater national and regional public good.The proposed scenarios target the AHS capacity: (i) to produce, manage, translate and communicatehydrometeorological (hydromet) information to the user community; (ii) to assist the community inaccessing, interpreting and using the information; (iii) to better disseminate and respond to warnings for public safety and economic security; and (iv) to inform planning and decision-making for cost-effective investments in climate-resilient development. Strengthening these four pillars can help solidify Armenia’s resilience to natural hazards and climate change. And help enhance the economic performance of such weather-dependent sectors as agriculture, energy, transport and water resources management. In the end, the purpose of this analysis is to support the government of Armenia in saving lives and livelihoods and in protecting gains in social and economic development through a robust but discerning hydromet system.","Modernizing Weather, Climate and Hydrological Services : A Road Map for Armenia",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/684751548347371395/pdf/134019-WP-P167315-Hydrometeorological-Report-Armenia-September2018-Final.pdf,/research/2018/09/30783364/modernizing-weather-climate-hydrological-services-road-map-armenia,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/684751548347371395/Modernizing-Weather-Climate-and-Hydrological-Services-A-Road-Map-for-Armenia,684751548347371395,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/684751548347371395/Modernizing-Weather-Climate-and-Hydrological-Services-A-Road-Map-for-Armenia,D30783364,88,2018/09/30783364/modernizing-weather-climate-hydrological-services-road-map-armenia,"Mirzoyan,Nora","Dube,Tafadzwa Irvine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,Commonwealth of Independent States,Asia,,,South Eastern Europe and Balkans,,,,

The WATCAP is intended to help to bridge the gap between the climate change predictions for the SRB and the decision makers in current and planned water management investment projects that will be affected by changing climate trends. The purpose of the report is to: (i) assist stakeholders and decision makers in assessing and planning for the risks generated by climate change impacts on water resources; (ii) provide a basis for future plans and studies of adaptation to climate change impacts in the SRB; and (iii) stimulate cooperation and debate across the basin toward additional and more detailed studies on climate change impacts at the regional and basin scale. The SRB is projected to experience small increases in water use by the public water supply, industry, energy, and agricultural and irrigation sectors.

The Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) reports six severe hydro-meteorological events in Jamaica during the period 2002-2007 which resulted in massive flooding, damage to infrastructure and losses. Much of the affected communities and towns are coastal and the repeated flood events have also resulted in coastal erosion. In light of the extreme events affecting life and livelihood in Jamaica, and the growing vulnerability of coastal communities to inundation and erosion, The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) has developed national strategies and policies to promote resilient developments. The concept of using mangroves as natural barriers to coastal erosion came into scientific knowledge and developed into policies following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2005 storm surge from Hurricane Katrina that affected New Orleans. As a part of work on disaster risk reduction and protection of coastlines the GOJ had received funding from the World Bank (WB) Program on Forests (PROFOR) to implement the Analytics and Advisory Services (ASA). This activity was supervised by the World Bank, and led at the local level by the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA).

The emergency response capacity of the General Directorate for civil emergencies is gradually being strengthened through the acquisition of emergency response equipment and already established the national emergency command and control center. The feasibility study for the creation of an integrated emergency call system 112 was completed. A national operation center at the Ministry of Interior in Tirana was established and a parallel Center was set up at the new Institute of Geosciences, Energy, Water and Environment (IGEWE) headquarters, as well as two provincial centers for civil emergencies. The process of upgrading the monitoring and forecasting system via the automated hydro-meteorological network and central data management system is being launched. The development of national guidelines for the adaptation of European building codes was completed and the training and dissemination workshop conducted. The integration of Euro code 8 (the seismic code) will provide Albania with the basis for a new building code. Albania is a member of the Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CRIF) and there is a steady progress in cat insurance product development and work on the web-based insurance platform.

It would establish a program of hydrometeorological observations in Wadi Beihan for improving knowledge of its water resources and ensuring their optimal utilization. In addition, it would improve access between agricultural and population centers in Wadi Beihan by constructing feeder roads, and improve the nutrition of the local population by increasing production of fruits, vegetables and meat. The project would benefit directly 5,000 families. In addition, 15,000 persons would benefit indirectly from the project through the increased availability of foodstuffs and easier access to markets and social and administrative services. The principal risks of not achieving the project's objectives are associated with an unsustainable rate of drawdown of groundwater in the project area and delays in realizing full production benefits.

The irrigation restoration and development program (IRDP) was added to the TPM program and the supervisory agent (SA) branched out to two new initiatives: a ministry training center (MTC) at the ministry of education (MoE) and a community monitoring (CM) program to supplement IRDP under the ministry of energy and water (MoEW). Chief among the many successes of second year was that of the CM pilot program. Implemented in second year and providing observations throughout the second half of the year, the CM program under IRDP was quickly recognized as an invaluable tool for MoEW. The near real-time data from project sites provided the ministry with the ability to effectively monitor construction progress remotely with fewer travel costs and security risks. The CM program also provides a tool for verifying rectification of deficiencies quickly and efficiently. Additionally during second year, the SA began the development of ""road maps"" for ensuring that Common Monitoring and Reporting (CMORE) data and systems are integrated with the existing ministry systems. This is critical so that ministry databases may be populated with the vast amounts of information collected by the SA and that information seamlessly integrates with the systems used in regular operations.","Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund (ARTF) supervisory agent : second year annual report - September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/496531468195558970/pdf/830510AR0ARTF00Box0379882B00PUBLIC0.pdf,/research/2013/11/18575407/afghanistan-reconstruction-trust-fund-artf-supervisory-agent-second-year-annual-report-september-1-2012-august-31-2013,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/496531468195558970/Afghanistan-reconstruction-trust-fund-ARTF-supervisory-agent-second-year-annual-report-September-1-2012-to-August-31-2013,496531468195558970,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/496531468195558970/Afghanistan-reconstruction-trust-fund-ARTF-supervisory-agent-second-year-annual-report-September-1-2012-to-August-31-2013,D18575407,22,2013/11/18575407/afghanistan-reconstruction-trust-fund-artf-supervisory-agent-second-year-annual-report-september-1-2012-august-31-2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,South Asia,Asia,Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund,,,,,,

Comprehensive pollution monitoring in urban areas has been too costly for many developing countries; yet sparse information has hindered cost-effective pollution management strategies. Global information technologies offer a potential escape from this information trap, but their accuracy remains uncertain. This paper uses ground-based measures of fine particulates and nitrogen dioxide, provided by the CAMS-3 Darussalam monitoring station in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to test three global technologies: the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and Google Traffic. The results indicate that all three global technologies can provide useful information for extension of air pollution measurement beyond the few areas that are currently monitored by ground stations. Each technology tracks ground-based fine particulates measures with high significance, and the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P and Google Traffic perform similarly for ground-based nitrogen dioxide measures. Google Traffic can provide accurate tracking at higher spatial and temporal resolution than the satellite sources, but only for emissions from motor vehicles in major metro areas. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P capture the effects of emissions from other sources at all locations.",Global Technology for Local Monitoring of Air Pollution in Dhaka,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/583491602078309833/pdf/Global-Technology-for-Local-Monitoring-of-Air-Pollution-in-Dhaka.pdf,/research/2020/10/32469668/global-technology-local-monitoring-air-pollution-dhaka,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/583491602078309833/Global-Technology-for-Local-Monitoring-of-Air-Pollution-in-Dhaka,583491602078309833,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/583491602078309833/Global-Technology-for-Local-Monitoring-of-Air-Pollution-in-Dhaka,D32469668,24,2020/10/32469668/Global-Technology-for-Local-Monitoring-of-Air-Pollution-in-Dhaka,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Asia,World,South Asia,"Policy Research working paper,no.

Most of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Reducing PM2.5 air pollution is thus crucial for improving public-health outcomes in those countries. Measuring and reducing the health impacts of PM2.5 is especially challenging in many LMICs because ground-level air-quality monitoring networks are typically nonexistent. Where they are in place, they are often not properly operated and maintained and are thus unreliable. Limited local expertise in air-quality measurement presents additional challenges. These shortcomings can undermine a country’s ability to design and implement effective policies to improve outdoor air quality. Satellite technology has been used successfully for measuring air quality in high-income countries where operation of ground-level air-quality monitoring networks is well established. However, Getting Down to Earth: Are Satellites Reliable for Measuring Air Pollutants That Cause Mortality in Low- and Middle-Income Countries investigates the performance of satellites in LMICs for predicting outdoor concentrations of PM2.5, based on case studies in nine cities in different regions representing a range of environmental conditions (including mountainous, dusty, and coastal). The report finds that the satellite-derived estimates of PM2.5 in LMICs are associated with very large uncertainty, ranging from 21 percent to 85 percent depending on the model used for translating satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth, the parameter measured by satellites, to surface-level outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. This report shows that satellites are unreliable for estimating ambient concentrations of PM2.5 in LMICs. Furthermore, satellite-derived measurements cannot replace properly operated and maintained ground-level monitoring networks for measuring the concentrations of PM2.5 that human beings are typically exposed to daily. Thus, it is important that LMICs strengthen support for the establishment of ground-level monitoring networks to measure air pollutants, notably PM2.5, that cause mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions with LMICs.",Getting Down to Earth : Are Satellites Reliable for Measuring Air Pollutants that Cause Mortality in Low- and Middle-Income Countries?,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/445131641786854437/pdf/Getting-Down-to-Earth-Are-Satellites-Reliable-for-Measuring-Air-Pollutants-that-Cause-Mortality-in-Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries.pdf,/research/2022/06/33700004/getting-down-earth-satellites-reliable-measuring-air-pollutants-cause-mortality-low--middle-income-countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/445131641786854437/Getting-Down-to-Earth-Are-Satellites-Reliable-for-Measuring-Air-Pollutants-that-Cause-Mortality-in-Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries,445131641786854437,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/445131641786854437/Getting-Down-to-Earth-Are-Satellites-Reliable-for-Measuring-Air-Pollutants-that-Cause-Mortality-in-Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries,D33700004,195,2022/06/33700004/Getting-Down-to-Earth-Are-Satellites-Reliable-for-Measuring-Air-Pollutants-that-Cause-Mortality-in-Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries,"Hegarty,Jennifer","Kennelly, Edward","Lynch,Richard","McVey,Amy","Cross,Eben","Onasch,Timothy",,,,,,,978-1-4648-1727-4,,,,,,,International Development in Focus,,,,,,

The essential ingredient of coal-bed gas is CH4, analogous to natural gas, which is a kind of clean energy, and, pollutants emitted from the power plant with coal-bed gas, is principally NOX with no smoke, dust or solid waste. The Sihe Plant will employ gas engines to generate electric power, and adopt a secondary circulation cooling system. Yet, the main sewage of Sihe Plant is domestic sewage, oil contaminated wastewater, and acidic and alkaline wastewater, while the principal impact on ambient air will be NO2. Mitigation measures suggest that every section workshop be equipped with a 60m-long stack with inside diameters of 2m, to allow fuel gas from 4 exhaust heat boilers, to be emitted from one stack, with an outlet velocity for every stack, thus ground concentration of NO2 would drop significantly, and comply with relevant standards. Alternative schemes suggest the Plant also replace 975kW single units with larger scale single units, such as 1800kW of gas engines, and fit exhaust heat boilers of larger evaporation capacity, to increase fuel gas volume at stack outlets. Additionally, with dilution nitrogen burning techniques, and ratio adjustment between fuel and air, NOX emission concentration can be reduced. Impact on the surrounding aquatic environment (acidic and alkaline wastewaters) are to be treated prior to discharge, while separation of oil contamination from waste waters should be practiced, and sewage treated through septic tanks. To abate noise disturbances, noise insulation, basic vibration insulation, indoors noise absorption, and fitting exhaust muffler, should mitigate noise disturbances. The Plant is located in an industrial zone occupying barren land, with no rare, nor endangered plant or animal species, therefore no impacts are expected on the ecological environment, actually, given the plant will be constructed on green, barren land, it is expected ecological aspects will improve.

This included analyzing barriers and gaps preventing evaluation of risks and adaptation options, and understanding the roles of different stakeholders (private and public) in addressing those constraints. The studies also aimed to provide information that reduces uncertainty about present-day and future climate related risks to the pilot study clients. In this context, the pilot studies should be viewed as an initial step towards elaboration of general tools for climate risk assessment and evaluation of adaptation options, for use in the private sector. The studies required data on observed and future climatic conditions. Observed data were obtained from a variety of sources, including the client companies, national meteorological agencies, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Data Distribution Centre (IPCC DDC). The data on future climate change were used to assess risks to the performance of the pilot study projects.",Climate risk and business : practical methods for assessing risk,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/657271468323058769/pdf/626520WP0Pract00Box0361488B0PUBLIC0.pdf,/research/2010/01/14429238/climate-risk-business-practical-methods-assessing-risk,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/657271468323058769/Climate-risk-and-business-practical-methods-for-assessing-risk,657271468323058769,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/657271468323058769/Climate-risk-and-business-practical-methods-for-assessing-risk,D14429238,46,2017/05/14429238/climate-risk-business-practical-methods-assessing-risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitigation measures include: 1) to determine specific sound level measurements of typical machines to be used particularly those activities that have been identified to be noisy or produce sound levels above daytime noise criteria; 2) provide a safe and adequate diversion for every road link that is closed during the construction phase. The traffic flow to and from terminal two and the established parking lots needs to be maintained at all times; 3) all material resulting from construction must be put in a location protected from wind and regularly sprayed with water until reused for fill or disposed of outside the site; 4) temporary haul roads shall be watered whilst in use to reduce dust production during construction; 5) all hauling trucks must be securely covered to eliminate dust scatter while moving in and out of the site; 6) contractor documents should include waste management plans to include recycling of solid wastes and off site proper disposal of solid hazardous wastes; 7) all construction wastes and wastes from contractors' camps and offices will be disposed to designated sites only. Wastes are mainly large stones, loose sandy soil, paper, cement bags, wood, paint holders, and food residues; and 8) all offices are to be provided with approved sanitary facilities.

Physical infrastructure at ports and port activities may be highly vulnerable to changes in climate. For instance, the risks could manifest through changes in the level or patterns of shipping, increased flooding affecting movements within ports and causing damage to goods stored, reduced navigability of access channels and business interruption. Some ports will also see opportunities as a result of climate change. A port's reputation for reliability is key to its success, so ports that are more resilient to disruption from climate events should fare better. Changes in trade flows driven by climate change will also see winners and losers. To understand the significance of these risks for a given port, this study assesses risks and opportunities for ports in general, and specifically for IFC's client, Terminal Marítimo Muelles el Bosque (MEB), in Cartagena, Colombia.","Climate risk and business : ports - terminal maritimo Muelles el Bosque Cartagena, Colombia : Appendices",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645371468021874614/pdf/626420PUB00Por00Box0361488B0PUBLIC0.pdf,/research/2011/04/14416694/climate-risk-business-ports-terminal-maritimo-muelles-el-bosque-cartagena-colombia-appendices,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645371468021874614/Appendices,645371468021874614,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645371468021874614/Appendices,D14416694,156,2011/04/14416694/climate-risk-business-ports-terminal-maritimo-muelles-el-bosque-cartagena-colombia-appendices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,South America,Latin America & Caribbean,Climate Risk Case Study,,,,,,

Based on an original survey of village-level units in Vietnam, this study compares nighttime light output from the U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) against ground-based survey data on electrical infrastructure and electricity use in 200 electrified villages. Monthly and annual composites record a one-point increase in brightness along DMSP-OLS’s 63-point brightness scale for every 60–70 additional street lights or 240–270 electrified homes. Using a time series of 90 nightly images, the data show a one-point increase in brightness for every 125–200 additional streetlights, or 550–700 additional electrified homes. The results highlight the potential to use night lights imagery to support efforts to connect the 1.2 billion people who lack electricity around the world.",Tracking electrification in Vietnam using night time lights,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/317421467988883892/pdf/102491-JRN-Box394835B-PUBLIC-Tracking-Electrification-in-Vietnam.pdf,/research/2014/10/25817611/tracking-electrification-vietnam-using-night-time-lights,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/317421467988883892/Tracking-electrification-in-Vietnam-using-night-time-lights,317421467988883892,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/317421467988883892/Tracking-electrification-in-Vietnam-using-night-time-lights,D25817611,19,2016/01/25817611/tracking-electrification-vietnam-using-night-time-lights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Southeast Asia,World,Asia,Author accepted manuscript,,,,,,

The report details likely environmental impacts and proposes measures to mitigate expected negative impacts. The plan involves the population in mitigation activities, carries out awareness and formal training, protects workers and residents from electric magnetic field radiation from potentially cancer-causing high voltage power, sets up entities to monitor environmental impacts on the entire transmission line-particularly impacts on fauna, flora, human and wildlife habitats, rivers, and sacred zones. Local institutions will oversee an environmental audit that focuses on air emissions reduction (carbon dioxide), waste oil treatment and disposal, noise abatement and management, worker health and safety (protective clothing and equipment), and HIV/AIDS awareness and education, fuel wood management, and decommissioning any equipment likely to damage the environment. During construction, use a plant effluent to reduce dust, possibly reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by increasing the height of the stack and procuring low-sulfur-content fuel, minimize water used in equipment, segregate water by source and treat appropriately (domestic wastewater, oily water, etc.), install a new incinerator to burn sludge generated, and observe maximum noise limits. Nuisances affecting quality of life (noise, dust, waste, risks) will be temporary during construction, and should have no significant effect during the operational phase if norms set by the World Bank and the Government are respected. Likely accidents to occur-hydrocarbon spills, fires, and explosions-would have no impact on residential areas because of remoteness, a site clear of brush and woods. Nonetheless, preventive measures proposed to eliminate or minimize the risks of accidents included a fire protection system (alarms, sprinklers, extinguishers,, etc.) and retaining basins for oil tanks and transformers.",Burkina Faso - Energy Sector Reform Project : environmental impact study (Vol. 4) : Executive summary,,/projects/documents/2004/08/2963157/burkina-faso-energy-sector-reform-project-environmental-impact-study-vol-4-executive-summary,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/819491468769899071/Executive-summary,819491468769899071,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/819491468769899071/Executive-summary,D2963157,,2004/08/2963157/burkina-faso-energy-sector-reform-project-environmental-impact-study-vol-4-12-executive-summary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other Energy and Extractives,Power",,,World,Sahel,Sub-Saharan Africa,,environmental impact study;noise level;industrial area;construction and operation;human environment;risk of accident;shallow water table;demand for energy;residual fuel oil;internal combustion engine;ambient ozone concentration;risk of death;types of accident;cooling water;ambient air;atmospheric emission;oily water;heavy rain;noise impact;atmospheric dispersion;air intake;noise environment;fire protection;technological risk;wind gust;protective measure;preventive measure;hydrocarbon vapor;heavy oil;accident analyses;accident history;software package;flood plain;air transport;rainy season;natural risks;hydrocarbon spills;residential area;oil tank;extreme weather;rail transport;meteorological condition;plant life;noise exposure;noise characteristics;holding tanks;domestic waste;rain water;stack height;water consumption;construction site;risk perception;land use;dispersion model;local area;combustion air;diesel engine;continuous basis;Waste Management;electrical power;meteorological data;dust control;access road;vehicular traffic;water system;city water;kv substation;railway track;environmental component;public area;flood zone;,West Africa,,,,

Its adverse effects are pervasive and may be disaggregated at three levels: (a) local, confined to urban and industrial centers; (b) regional, pertaining to transboundary transport of pollutants; and (c) global, related to build up of greenhouse gases. These effects have been observed globally but the characteristics and scale of the air pollution problem in developing countries are not known; nor has the problem been researched and evaluated to the same extent as in industrialized countries. Air pollution, however, can no longer be regarded as a local or a regional issue as it has global repercussions in terms of the greenhouse effect and depletion of the ozone layer. This paper discusses the contribution of motorized land transport to air pollution problems, with special reference to developing countries. It assesses the adverse effects of air pollution from transport sources, primarily motor vehicles, and reviews possible approaches to bring about improvements.

The analysis identifies gaps and challenges in producing and delivering fit-for-purpose weather, climate, hydrological, forest fire, and radiation-related information and services. The road map aims to provide the Government of the Republic of Belarus with a technical strategic framework to improve hydromet, forest fire, radiation monitoring and early warning services and systems, and the resulting socioeconomic benefits. The expectation is for Belarus to improve its capability and capacity to: (i) produce, manage, translate, and communicate hydromet, forest fire and radiation-related data and information, including forecasts and warnings for stakeholders and end-users; (ii) assist stakeholders and end-users in accessing, interpreting, and utilizing the generated data and information; (iii) improve the dissemination of and response to warnings for public safety and economic security; (iv) inform planning and decision-making for cost-effective investments in sustainable development and adaptation to climate change; and (v) make optimum use of all investments from the government and development partners. The road map lays out the current context of hydromet in Belarus, identifies the principal stakeholders and end-user community, and weighs these two factors against Belhydromet’s long-term strategy and the law of the Republic of Belarus. The road map drills down on the financial and technical infrastructure to determine if Belhydromet has the tools to match the country’s expectations and needs for services. The findings indicate: more robust tools can transform Belhydromet into a technically modern and sound hydromet service. The road map articulates three scenarios to transform Belhydromet to better deliver hydromet, forest fire and radiation-related information, and early warning services and systems.",Strengthening Hydromet and Early Warning Services in Belarus : A Road Map,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/839291594879784721/pdf/Strengthening-Hydromet-and-Early-Warning-Services-in-Belarus-A-Road-Map.pdf,/research/2020/04/32247806/strengthening-hydromet-early-warning-services-belarus-road-map,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/839291594879784721/Strengthening-Hydromet-and-Early-Warning-Services-in-Belarus-A-Road-Map,839291594879784721,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/839291594879784721/Strengthening-Hydromet-and-Early-Warning-Services-in-Belarus-A-Road-Map,D32247806,110,2020/04/32247806/,"Schaffhauser,Andreas","Fiorucci,Paolo","Bedrina,Tatiana","Nemova,Vladislava I.","Kull,Daniel Werner",,,,,,,,,,,,South Eastern Europe and Balkans,World,Commonwealth of Independent States,,,,,,,

Climate change is likely to increase the number and size of these fires and subsequent smoke plumes. These smoke plumes change direct, diffuse, and total sunlight during the crop growing season and consequently influence yields of both corn and soybeans. The analysis in this paper uses a twelve-year panel of county-level yields from all counties east of the 100th meridian combined with measures of exposure to smoke plumes of low and high density during the growing season. It shows that low-density plumes enhance yields, likely by increasing in the fraction of diffuse light, while high-density plumes decrease yields. Because there are more low-density plumes today, the net effect is a slight increase in yields on average.

The analysis finds that incomes are negatively related to temperature, while life expectancy is not significantly related to average temperatures. Both incomes and life expectancy are greater in areas with either very little rain or a lot of rain. The authors use the estimated relationships to simulate the effects of both past (1958-08) and future (2008-58) climate change. The findings indicate that past climate change has been favorable for the central, and most populous, part of Chile, and it has contributed to reduced poverty and reduced inequality of health outcomes. Whereas temperatures in the past have shown a downward trend for most of the Chilean population, climate models suggest that they will increase in the future, and that there will be a reduction in precipitation in the central part of Chile. The analysis simulates the likely effects of these projected climate changes over the next 50 years. The findings suggest that expected future climate will tend to reduce incomes across the whole country, with an average reduction of about 7 percent, all other things equal.",Social impacts of climate change in Chile : a municipal level analysis of the effects of recent and future climate change on human development and inequality,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/319821468266372780/pdf/WPS5170.pdf,/research/2010/01/11633478/social-impacts-climate-change-chile-municipal-level-analysis-effects-recent-future-climate-change-human-development-inequality,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/319821468266372780/Social-impacts-of-climate-change-in-Chile-a-municipal-level-analysis-of-the-effects-of-recent-and-future-climate-change-on-human-development-and-inequality,319821468266372780,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/319821468266372780/Social-impacts-of-climate-change-in-Chile-a-municipal-level-analysis-of-the-effects-of-recent-and-future-climate-change-on-human-development-and-inequality,D11633478,29,2010/01/11633478/Social-impacts-of-climate-change-in-Chile-a-municipal-level-analysis-of-the-effects-of-recent-and-future-climate-change-on-human-development-and-inequality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other social services,Renewable energy",Other environment and natural resources management,Environment and natural resource management,,,,Policy Research working paper ; no.

Modern weather forecasting adopts a cascading approach where numerical products developed by global producing centers feed regional and national models, with national forecasters assimilating these and other data to produce information customized for local users. The system depends on global producing centers sharing their products, often through voluntary action without dedicated financing, which is not sustainable and does not fully leverage the capacity of global producing centers to provide tailored information. It would be economically viable for global producing centers to provide their full suite of services to low-income countries, producing likely global socioeconomic benefits of US$200 million to US$500 million per year, outweighing the costs by about 80 to one. Existing global producing centers' capacities and their potential benefits for low-income countries fulfill the utilitarian principal. Global numerical weather prediction should therefore be treated as a global public good. However, although recent global development and climate agreements clearly suggest that improving forecasting in low-income countries should be a target of international cooperation, official development assistance financing of high-income country global producing centers to provide products to low-income countries would be considered tied aid. Specialized mechanisms, such as the Green Climate Fund, could provide legitimate means to finance global producing centers to provide global public services in support of low-income countries. However, to realize the potential benefits, significant investment is needed in regional and national forecasting, early warning, and preparedness capacities.","Strengthening national hydrometeorological services through cascading forecasting : investing for sustainability and impact across global, regional, and national centers",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/162381468184794497/pdf/WPS7609.pdf,/research/2016/03/26089546/strengthening-national-hydrometeorological-services-through-cascading-forecasting-investing-sustainability-impact-across-global-regional-national-centers,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/162381468184794497/Strengthening-national-hydrometeorological-services-through-cascading-forecasting-investing-for-sustainability-and-impact-across-global-regional-and-national-centers,162381468184794497,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/162381468184794497/Strengthening-national-hydrometeorological-services-through-cascading-forecasting-investing-for-sustainability-and-impact-across-global-regional-and-national-centers,D26089546,33,2016/03/26089546/Strengthening-national-hydrometeorological-services-through-cascading-forecasting-investing-for-sustainability-and-impact-across-global-regional-and-national-centers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Policy Research working paper,no.

The project would result in a move towards the core railway network whose size, management, operation and regulation, are commensurate with the market demands for freight, and passenger transport, and will facilitate Romania's accession to the European Union (EU). This environmental assessment reviews the country's environmental legal and regulatory framework, identifies potential environmental adversity due to construction works, and its impact on soil erosion, land degradation, groundwater pollution, and air pollution as a whole, within the seven bypass areas, and, provides mitigation measures as follows. To improve the groundwater quality levels, prior its drainage into the outlet, settlers and grease separators have been developed for installation at each bypass. To further protect groundwater, and soil quality, septic tanks were designed to collect wastewaters, and undergo a treatment process. Groundwater quality monitoring is to be carried out by a network of observation boreholes, while the physical and chemical analyses should be performed once a semester, through exploitation would capture boreholes for supervision, near the industrial platforms. Emission levels resulting from road transport, are insignificant at the country emissions' level, which based on the tests on air samples taken at the different areas (for which NH3, NO2, SO2, and total dust suspensions were determined, except NH3), all the maximum admissible limits have not been exceeded. Concerning heavy metals, lead has recorded high levels, while pollutant concentrations of lead and oil petroleum products from the by-pass route produced normal soil values. However, in the road area, the soil quality affects: lower local fertility, erosion in combination with landslides, contamination due to weeds, and, industrial pollution on limited areas. Livestock crossings, and traffic (including agricultural machinery) regulations shall be designed and enforced, including adequate access roads.

Most analyses along these lines have focused on impacts on gross domestic product. This paper looks beyond this standard national accounting aggregate, and examines whether traditional and alternative national savings measures combined with adjustments for the destruction of capital stocks may contribute to better explaining post-disaster changes in welfare as measured by changes in consumption expenditure. The author concludes that including disaster asset losses may help to better explain variations in post-disaster consumption, albeit almost exclusively for the group of low-income countries. The observed effect is rather small and in the range of a few percent of the explained variation. For low-income countries, capital stock and changes therein, such as forced by disaster shocks, seem to play a more important role than for higher-income economies, where human capital and technological progress become crucial. There are important data constraints and uncertainties, particularly regarding the quality of disaster loss data and the shares of capital stock losses therein. Another important challenge potentially biasing the results is the lack of data on alternative savings measures for many disaster-exposed lower-income countries and small island states.",Disasters and economic welfare : can national savings help explain post-disaster changes in consumption ?,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/738261468331773072/pdf/WPS4988.pdf,/research/2009/07/10779856/disasters-economic-welfare-can-national-savings-help-explain-post-disaster-changes-consumption,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/738261468331773072/Disasters-and-economic-welfare-can-national-savings-help-explain-post-disaster-changes-in-consumption,738261468331773072,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/738261468331773072/Disasters-and-economic-welfare-can-national-savings-help-explain-post-disaster-changes-in-consumption,D10779856,33,2009/07/10779856/Disasters-and-economic-welfare-can-national-savings-help-explain-post-disaster-changes-in-consumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Policy Research working paper ; no.

Based on the review of the country's environmental legal framework, the European Union's environmental principles, and the Bank's operational guidelines, this environmental assessment stipulates mitigation measures as follows. By and large, the most significant impacts determined were emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and noise disturbances. During construction, tender documents shall include precautionary clauses that require spraying, and surface covering to prevent dusting, and air pollution; daytime working schedules that minimize noise disturbance; and, chemical testing, and analysis to be conducted prior to an adequate disposal of excavated soil, and pollutants, such as heavy metal content. At the operation stages, all emissions - waste gas volume flows, temperature, emission concentrations of NOx and carbon monoxide (CO) - shall be tested in compliance with the manufacturer's regulations, and include as well, the installation of low-NOx-motors, and silencer devices, monitored through standard metering equipment.

Directed at policy makers, practitioners, and the wider public, the report explains the UHI effect and its drivers, as well as potential risk management and adaptation measures to address them. One of the report’s key messages is that in the context of cities and changing climate, policy and investment decisions can be facilitated by scientific approaches that provide information on current and future climate, and that increase understanding of measures to reduce UHI effects. Along with potential adaptation measures, this report also highlights the need to increase public awareness of, and emergency preparedness for, urban heat impacts on people and societies. The report also includes a number of city examples and case studies, selected based on availability of information, and relevance for other cities in the region. By introducing adaptive and preparedness policy options, this report also promotes the integration of disaster risk management approaches in the urban context. This integration is illustrated through a roadmap for increased resilience to urban heat. This roadmap highlights the key steps that cities can take to better understand the scope of UHI effects and in turn integrate this information into broader resilience or urban development plans and strategies.",Analysis of Heat Waves and Urban Heat Island Effects in Central European Cities and Implications for Urban Planning,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/740251596528336330/pdf/Analysis-of-Heat-Waves-and-Urban-Heat-Island-Effects-in-Central-European-Cities-and-Implications-for-Urban-Planning.pdf,/research/2020/04/32298534/analysis-heat-waves-urban-heat-island-effects-central-european-cities-implications-urban-planning,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/740251596528336330/Analysis-of-Heat-Waves-and-Urban-Heat-Island-Effects-in-Central-European-Cities-and-Implications-for-Urban-Planning,740251596528336330,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/740251596528336330/Analysis-of-Heat-Waves-and-Urban-Heat-Island-Effects-in-Central-European-Cities-and-Implications-for-Urban-Planning,D32298534,56,2020/04/32298534/,"Staudinger,Michael","Zuvela-Aloise, Maja","de Wit,Rosemarie","Hollósi,Brigitta","Kainz,Astrid","Oswald,Sandro","Hahn,Claudia","Goler,Robert","Percec Tadic,Melita","Nimac,Irena","Herceg Bulic,Ivana","Bokwa,Anita",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These models rely on computer technology and the latest earth and meteorological science information to generate thousands if not millions of simulated events. Recently observed hurricane activity, particularly in the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, in conjunction with recently published scientific literature has led risk modelers to revisit their hurricane models and develop climate conditioned hurricane models. This paper discusses these climate conditioned hurricane models and compares their risk estimates to those of base normal hurricane models. This comparison shows that the recent 50 year period of climate change has potentially increased North Atlantic hurricane frequency by 30 percent. However, such an increase in hurricane frequency would result in an increase in risk to human property that is equivalent to less than 10 years worth of US coastal property growth. Increases in potential extreme losses require the reinsurance industry to secure additional risk capital for these peak risks, resulting in the short term in lower risk capacity for developing countries. However, reinsurers and investors in catastrophe securities may still have a long-term interest in providing catastrophe coverage in middle and low-income countries as this allows reinsurers and investors to better diversify their catastrophe risk portfolios.",The impact of climate change on catastrophe risk models : implications for catastrophe risk markets in developing countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/277731468148518556/pdf/WPS4959.pdf,/research/2009/06/10645285/impact-climate-change-catastrophe-risk-models-implications-catastrophe-risk-markets-developing-countries,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/277731468148518556/The-impact-of-climate-change-on-catastrophe-risk-models-implications-for-catastrophe-risk-markets-in-developing-countries,277731468148518556,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/277731468148518556/The-impact-of-climate-change-on-catastrophe-risk-models-implications-for-catastrophe-risk-markets-in-developing-countries,D10645285,18,2009/06/10645285/The-impact-of-climate-change-on-catastrophe-risk-models-implications-for-catastrophe-risk-markets-in-developing-countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Policy Research working paper ; no.

Some of the negative and mitigation measures include: livestock and pastures are the assets on which herdsmen live on; compensation for the conversion of rights of pasture use is to ensure that their livelihood condition does not fall. Compensation may be done to increase employment opportunities, or to help them adapt to the new form of livelihood, or can directly remove restrictions on pasture use. But such compensation is conditional; it gradually reduces the number of livestock in protected areas as a precondition. According to the survey, the current poverty situation remains severe. Kekebasitao residents almost all below the absolute poverty, incomes in Wusu three livestock teams also less than the average of Wusu and Guertu Township. The lives of poor people are still relatively difficult and opportunities to increase income are relatively less. As the slow income growth, the gap between have and have-not is widening. In the surveys on Kekebasitao Settlement and livestock teams of Guertu Town, the local residents expressed their active support willing to the construction of the protected area. They hope the government will speed up the construction of pastoral settlements and provide more employment opportunities and job training, especially for their children.",China - Sustainable Management and Biodiversity Conservation of the Lake Aibi Basin Project : indigenous peoples plan : Ethnic minority development plan and process framework,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/243141468217153131/pdf/IPP4830P1106611work1english0version.pdf,/projects/documents/2011/02/13894608/china-sustainable-management-biodiversity-conservation-lake-aibi-basin-project-indigenous-peoples-plan-ethnic-minority-development-plan-process-framework,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/243141468217153131/Ethnic-minority-development-plan-and-process-framework,243141468217153131,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/243141468217153131/Ethnic-minority-development-plan-and-process-framework,D13894608,58,2011/02/13894608/china-sustainable-management-biodiversity-conservation-lake-aibi-basin-project-indigenous-peoples-plan-ethnic-minority-development-plan-process-framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,General finance sector,,,World,East Asia and Pacific,Asia,,,,,,,

Some lessons learned included: for technically innovative and institutionally complex projects such as the establishment of hydrological information system (HIS) across India, a long-term programmatic and demand driven approach is required, allowing each implementing agency (IA) to progress at its own pace and evolving needs. Central agencies need to take a spearheading role regarding HIS data exchange and dissemination, in order to accelerate the present paradigm shift towards river basin planning and integrated water resources management (IWRM) in India. Integration of state surface water (SW) and ground water (GW) departments and (particularly) state data centers facilitates and promotes the integration of SW and GW data analyses, enables the adoption of an IWRM approach at state level, and improves joint project management and implementation. Web-based data processing and storage systems facilitate easy accessibility across the country, central annual maintenance contract (AMC) and help desk functions, and reduce potential future licensing issues. Management information system (MIS) systems for projects of the nature of HIS - which cannot be subjected to a classic economic and financial analysis - need to implement data-related value-addition studies as part of the monitoring and evaluation and learning (M and E and L) environment, by developing a benefit assessment mechanism for HIS-related activities.",India - Second Phase of the Hydrology Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515661468252269884/pdf/ICR29310P0846300disclosed0120220140.pdf,/projects/documents/2014/12/23075850/india-second-phase-hydrology-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515661468252269884/India-Second-Phase-of-the-Hydrology-Project,515661468252269884,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/515661468252269884/India-Second-Phase-of-the-Hydrology-Project,D23075850,74,2014/12/23075850/india-second-phase-hydrology-project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Irrigation and Drainage,General finance sector,Water Supply,Sub-National Government,Central Government (Central Agencies)",Water resource management,Environment and natural resource management,World,Asia,South Asia,,,,,,,

In 2016 the food security situation deteriorated sharply in Africa–especially in East and Southern Africa as a result of droughts and floods linked in part to El Niño/La Niña–related phenomena. The risk of the El Niño-induced food insecurity in southern Africa in 2016, the recent risk of famine in northern Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, and South Sudan, and the recent outbreak of the Fall Armyworm (FAW) in East and Southern Africa (ESA) all demonstrate that responses are still largely reactive than proactive. Inadequate Early Warning System (EWS), coupled with limited investment and weak institutional and technical capacity, are implicated in contributing to food insecurity-related emergencies in ESA. In supporting these efforts, an assessment of food security EWSs was conducted to improve food security and resilience3 in eastern and southern Africa.

These observed changes in climate parameters have not occurred uniformly across Africa. Mitigation is concerned with reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions in the Earth's atmosphere that are the principal causes of climate change. Adaptation is concerned not with prevention but, in the words of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, with adjustments in human and or natural systems to reduce adverse impacts or take advantage of opportunities that may arise from it. Information and communication technology (ICT) have had an increasing impact on economic and social development over the past two decades, resulting from their capacity to generate and disseminate information, to facilitate the coordination of different actors in and beyond government, and to make government, business, and development processes more efficient. ICTs also have a complex relationship with sustainability and with the underlying cause of climate change. This relationship can be described in terms of the effects of ICTs: first order (direct) effects concern the impacts which ICTs have on climate change, in particular the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the production, use and disposal of communications equipment and services, accounting for between 2 and 2.5 percent of global emissions. Second order (indirect) effects concern the role ICTs can play in reducing emissions resulting from other industrial sectors, by adopting ICTs to improve efficiency and production.

To control noise nuisance, select low-noise equipment, use shock absorbers and noise insulation, schedule reasonable operation times, ban night construction but if needed give local people advance notice, prohibit night driving, and warn local residents if blasting is needed. To control dust, use dustproof covers for machinery and cement areas, and spray area and access roads. To promote worker health and safety, set up medical facilities and encourage hygiene control, and train workers. To reduce soil erosion and surface water runoff, plan construction for the dry season, use designated sites for deposits, avoid disposal in water bodies, use silt traps, and restore farmland. Get official approval before proceeding with construction when finding cultural artifacts.

Tables are included showing the hydro potential, hydro development status and electricity supply forecast for each country, as well as aggregates for each of the six Bank geographical regions and for the combined regions. The data base used for the background study summarized by the paper was prepared in early 1982 so in many cases the electricity supply forecasts are somewhat overstated, at least for the short term, and may not adequately reflect the continuing stress in many countries.

Besides the many beneficial environmental aspects, the project will select advanced equipments, so the pollutants such as air, liquid or solid wastes will not be produced during the wind power generation; serious electromagnetic interference and sound pollution will not be produced, so there will be little negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, the wind farm can produce clean, and green energy which can replace coal-fired power, greatly reduce pollution of the environment, utilize natural re-generable resources, and save non-recoverable fossil fuel resources. Great environment and social results can be achieved from the project, so it is practicable in view of environmental protection. As per the State Environment Effect Evaluation Law, the Wulanchabu Environment Research Institute will take the responsibility of evaluating the environmental impact within the construction and operation period, provide indicators to prevent, or reduce negative impacts on the environment, and practice set monitoring criteria. Subprojects will generally cause minor impacts on the environment and should be minimized through standard mitigating measures. As such, the overall Project falls under Category B according to the Bank's operational policy on Environmental Assessment (OP4.01). However, owing to the possibility of great differences within subprojects on environmental issues, it is possible some subprojects may cause significant environmental issues, thus, could require (both by the Government of China and the Bank) a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (Category A EIA). Therefore, it is not suitable to prepare a uniform environmental assessment (EA) documentation for all subprojects. The purpose of this environmental assessment (EA) framework is to be used to provide guidance for the environmental assessment process to be followed in evaluating individual subprojects considered for financial support under the overall Project.","China - Second Renewable Energy Project : environmental assessment : Environment impact assessement - Huitengxile wind power, Inner Mongolia",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/537411468213274402/pdf/E12700v10EAP1EA1P096158v101Huitingxile1.pdf,/projects/documents/2005/01/6476118/china-second-renewable-energy-project-environmental-assessment-environment-impact-assessement-huitengxile-wind-power-inner-mongolia,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/537411468213274402/Environment-impact-assessement-Huitengxile-wind-power-Inner-Mongolia,537411468213274402,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/537411468213274402/Environment-impact-assessement-Huitengxile-wind-power-Inner-Mongolia,D6476118,28,2005/01/6476118/Environment-impact-assessement-Huitengxile-wind-power-Inner-Mongolia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Renewable energy,,,World,Asia,East Asia,,,,,,,

Informed by the practical realities of air quality monitoring, this paper employs a low-cost approach using passive and active monitors to obtain characterization of pollution levels based on particulate matter 2.5, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone over a six-month period (starting in December 2018) for selected urban centers in three of the four macro-regions in Uganda. This is the first attempt to comprehensively assess pollution levels at a near-national level in Uganda. A combination of distributed stationary monitors and mobile monitors installed on motorcycle taxis (boda-boda) was employed in selected parishes to obtain spatiotemporal variations in the pollutant concentrations. The results suggest that seasonal particulate levels heavily depend on precipitation patterns with a strong inverse relation, which further corroborates the need for longer monitoring periods to reflect actual seasonal variations. Informed by the observed level of data completeness and quality in all the monitoring scenarios, the paper highlights the practicability and potential of a low-cost approach to air quality monitoring and the potential to use this information to inform citizens.",Characterization of Ambient Air Quality in Selected Urban Areas in Uganda : A Low-Cost Approach,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/154911611166427828/pdf/Characterization-of-Ambient-Air-Quality-in-Selected-Urban-Areas-in-Uganda-A-Low-Cost-Approach.pdf,/research/2021/01/32764917/characterization-ambient-air-quality-selected-urban-areas-uganda-low-cost-approach,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/154911611166427828/Characterization-of-Ambient-Air-Quality-in-Selected-Urban-Areas-in-Uganda-A-Low-Cost-Approach,154911611166427828,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/154911611166427828/Characterization-of-Ambient-Air-Quality-in-Selected-Urban-Areas-in-Uganda-A-Low-Cost-Approach,D32764917,43,2021/01/32764917/Characterization-of-Ambient-Air-Quality-in-Selected-Urban-Areas-in-Uganda-A-Low-Cost-Approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,East Africa,World,Sub-Saharan Africa,"Policy Research working paper,no.

The importance of ex-ante actions depends on disaster risks and the likelihood of public assistance, which potentially creates substitution between the two actions. The findings show that higher future probabilities of disasters increase the likelihood of holding more human capital and/or livestock relative to land, and this asset-portfolio effect is significant in disaster prone areas. The empirical results support the roles of both ex-ante and ex-post responses (public assistance) in coping with disasters, but also show interesting variations across countries. In Ethiopia, public assistance plays a more important role than ex-ante actions to mitigate the impact of shocks on child schooling. In contrast, households in Malawi rely more on private ex-ante actions than public assistance. The Bangladesh example shows active roles of both ex-ante and ex-post actions. These observations are consistent with the finding on the relationship between ex-ante actions and disaster risks. The results also show that among ex-ante actions, human capital accumulated in the household prior to disasters helps mitigate the negative effects of disasters in both the short and long runs.","Risks, ex-ante actions and public assistance : impacts of natural disasters on child schooling in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Malawi",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/901771468274281613/pdf/WPS4909.pdf,/research/2009/04/10486849/risks-ex-ante-actions-public-assistance-impacts-natural-disasters-child-schooling-bangladesh-ethiopia-malawi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/901771468274281613/Risks-ex-ante-actions-and-public-assistance-impacts-of-natural-disasters-on-child-schooling-in-Bangladesh-Ethiopia-and-Malawi,901771468274281613,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/901771468274281613/Risks-ex-ante-actions-and-public-assistance-impacts-of-natural-disasters-on-child-schooling-in-Bangladesh-Ethiopia-and-Malawi,D10486849,35,2009/04/10486849/Risks-ex-ante-actions-and-public-assistance-impacts-of-natural-disasters-on-child-schooling-in-Bangladesh-Ethiopia-and-Malawi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Asia,East Africa,South Asia,Policy Research working paper ; no.

That metaphor applies not just to the vulnerable in the rich world; the vulnerable in the rest of the world are not more immune. Yet, despite the extensive spread of the virus, the mortality toll remains highly concentrated in high-income countries. Developing countries represent 85 percent of the global population, but only 21 percent of the pandemic's death toll. This unusual inequality creates the impression that the world is subjected to two different pandemics in terms of their impact. This paper documents the observed inequality with a new indicator that expresses severity relative to pre-pandemic patterns. It argues that the excessive skew towards rich countries is inconsistent with demography. Simulations based on reasonable ranges for infectivity and fatality suggest that the developing country share in global fatalities could rise by a factor of three (from 21 to 69 percent). Environmental and host-specific factors will influence these results but are unlikely to overturn them. While data quality has a role in explaining ‘excess inequality’, the more compelling explanation is that the pandemic has yet to run its course through the age distributions of the world.",COVID-19 Mortality in Rich and Poor Countries : A Tale of Two Pandemics ?,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/559181590712052524/pdf/COVID-19-Mortality-in-Rich-and-Poor-Countries-A-Tale-of-Two-Pandemics.pdf,/research/2020/05/32075802/covid-19-mortality-rich-poor-countries-tale-two-pandemics,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/559181590712052524/COVID-19-Mortality-in-Rich-and-Poor-Countries-A-Tale-of-Two-Pandemics,559181590712052524,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/559181590712052524/COVID-19-Mortality-in-Rich-and-Poor-Countries-A-Tale-of-Two-Pandemics,D32075802,35,2020/05/32075802/COVID-19-Mortality-in-Rich-and-Poor-Countries-A-Tale-of-Two-Pandemics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Policy Research working paper,no.

Aftermath of disasters typically place significant strain on the fiscal systems of affected countries. Consequently, ministers of the Central American integration system (SICA) and Caribbean community (CARICOM) countries have expressed a strong intention to collectively manage the disaster risk. By understanding the loss potential of disasters caused by natural events and the extent of public intervention in recovery and reconstruction efforts, governments can ascertain their respective contingent liabilities. Sovereign disaster risk financing and insurance can also safeguard against sudden macroeconomic shocks that negatively impact fiscal performance, and in turn, economic development. Caribbean and Central American governments are constrained in their ability to access quick liquidity to absorb fiscal shocks associated with natural hazard impacts because they have limited ability to create contingency funds, and limited capacity for external borrowing. The World Bank in partnership with the United States department of treasury assessed various options, which guided Ministers of Finance of Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic (COSEFIN) to identify the Caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility (CCRIF) as the best option. The CCRIF provides cost-effective and fast-disbursing liquidity, and is an efficient way to finance a liquidity gap arising in the immediate aftermath of disaster.",Caribbean and Central American partnership for catastrophe risk insurance : pooling risk to safeguard against catastrophes generated by natural events,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/704241468016218700/pdf/879240REVISED00une020140english0web.pdf,/research/2014/06/19771571/caribbean-central-american-partnership-catastrophe-risk-insurance-pooling-risk-safeguard-against-catastrophes-generated-natural-events,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/704241468016218700/Caribbean-and-Central-American-partnership-for-catastrophe-risk-insurance-pooling-risk-to-safeguard-against-catastrophes-generated-by-natural-events,704241468016218700,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/704241468016218700/Caribbean-and-Central-American-partnership-for-catastrophe-risk-insurance-pooling-risk-to-safeguard-against-catastrophes-generated-by-natural-events,D19771571,36,2014/06/19771571/caribbean-central-american-partnership-catastrophe-risk-insurance-pooling-risk-safeguard-against-catastrophes-generated-natural-events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Insurance and Pension,"Other Financial Sector Development,Other Private Sector Development",Financial and private sector development,,,,,,,,,,

Challenges to its deployment remain, however, including the lack of a robust track record; uncertainty about costs; uncertainty about the environmental impact; and the technical complexity of designing, building, and operating on and in water (especially electrical safety, anchoring and mooring issues, and operation and maintenance). This handbook provides developers, utilities, contractors, investors, regulators, and decision makers with practical guidelines on FPV projects. Most of the handbook focuses on technical aspects relating to developing and operating FPV projects; some sections focus on commercial and legal aspects. Most of the observations are made for inland water bodies or near-shore coastal FPV installations. Many observations incorporate learning and opinions from the industry, but they are also based on the experience from the 1 megawatt-peak (MWp) floating solar testbed in the Tengeh Reservoir in Singapore. The testbed has a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks more than 500 parameters in real time, ranging from electrical to meteorological and module-related factors. Given the early stage development of the technology, this handbook cannot answer all questions about FPV. Further studies and field data analysis are needed to better understand some of the risks of FPV systems, especially their environmental impact and long-term performance. All recommendations provided in this report are based on past and current experiences, which are limited to several years of operating data for most projects. A longer operating lifetime of FPV installations will lead to new and improved recommendations and best practices; new developments in technology,testing, certification, and equipment/materials deployed are likely to evolve as the industry grows and diversifies. An active dialogue among all stakeholders, public and private, is required to further the global understanding of FPV technologies and the development of well-designed projects while minimizing possible negative environmental and social impacts. Through this handbook, the World Bank Group, the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), and the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) hope to contribute to this goal and to disseminate lessons learned from early projects.",Where Sun Meets Water : Floating Solar Handbook for Practitioners,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/418961572293438109/pdf/Where-Sun-Meets-Water-Floating-Solar-Handbook-for-Practitioners.pdf,/research/2019/10/31512327/sun-meets-water-floating-solar-handbook-practitioners,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/418961572293438109/Where-Sun-Meets-Water-Floating-Solar-Handbook-for-Practitioners,418961572293438109,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/418961572293438109/Where-Sun-Meets-Water-Floating-Solar-Handbook-for-Practitioners,D31512327,155,2019/10/31512327/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of this methodology will allow planners and policy makers to better plan for adaptation measures to address the climate change impacts on the power and water supply sectors. This report presents the methodology used to assess impacts of climate change on mountain hydrology in Peru, and some of the results obtained from employing this methodology. Chapter two presents the method and results of the climate projections (climate analysis). Chapter three presents the hydrologic model (WEAP) and describes how it is modified to take into account the complex mountain hydrological system (hydrology analysis). In chapter four the results of the climate analysis are fed into the modified hydrologic tool to assess future hydrology conditions in selected basins in Peru.

Minimize dust emissions from land clearing, drilling and blasting, ground excavation, cut and fill operations, facility construction, and from equipment traffic over temporary roads at the construction site by using the following methods: Cover stockpiled material with suitable sheet material; sprinkle water on access roads, limit vehicle speed, cover vehicles, and maintain equipment and machinery. Mix ash with gypsum and convey to mining disposal area. Treat wastewater from workers before discharge to river bodies, and monitor groundwater quality. Solid waste from the personnel, medical wastes, and oily wastes, hazardous wastes such as used batteries, bitumen, cables, copper, fire-fighting foam, adhesives, general chemicals, acids, oil rags and absorbents, solvents, contaminated soils, insulation, paint sludge, used oil and paint cans and drums etc. and package wastes will be collected at black bags separated from medical, hazardous, dangerous and package wastes. Separately collected domestic wastes will be transported to temporary waste storage center or container by special vehicles and stored separately. Store recyclable wastes in different closed containers. Segregate paper, cardboards, plastics and metal package wastes according to their type and collected by blue bags. Handle other, including hazardous and medical, waste according to regulation. To control noise, restrict hours of operation and ensure vehicle noise does not exceed stated levels. To minimize industrial accidents, train personnel in health and safety issues, have workers wear protective equipment, set up health center on site, and use fire prevention measures.",Turkey - Energy Liberalization Project : environmental impact assessment summary : Rehabilitation of the Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/505581468338988167/pdf/35162.pdf,/projects/documents/2005/12/6579709/turkey-energy-liberalization-project-environmental-impact-assessment-summary-rehabilitation-afsin-elbistan-thermal-power-plant,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/505581468338988167/Rehabilitation-of-the-Afsin-Elbistan-A-Thermal-Power-Plant,505581468338988167,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/505581468338988167/Rehabilitation-of-the-Afsin-Elbistan-A-Thermal-Power-Plant,D6579709,26,2005/12/6579709/Rehabilitation-of-the-Afsin-Elbistan-A-Thermal-Power-Plant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Power,,,South Eastern Europe and Balkans,Asia,Europe,,,Middle East and North Africa,World,,,

From 2000 to 2012, more than 100 hurricanes impacted lives, infrastructure, and economic activity along the region’s shorelines. Studies suggest that mangrove forests’ dense root systems might mitigate the impact of hurricanes, which would help stabilize the coastline and prevent erosion from waves and storms. Although many tropical mangroves are found on Caribbean coasts, climatic and anthropogenic events have been clearing these wetland ecosystems at an annual rate of 1 percent since the 1990s. This study quantifies the effects of hurricane windstorms on economic activity using nightlight as a proxy at the highest spatial resolution data available (1 square kilometer). Using different widths of the mangrove belt, it measures levels of mangrove natural protection against the impact of hurricanes and studies the broader socioeconomic and environmental effects of this protection. The results suggest that while major hurricanes reduce nightlight by approximately 2 percent and up to 16 percent in storm surge prone areas, the presence of mangroves on the coast mitigates the impact of hurricanes, reducing nightlight by 1–6 percent.",Mangroves as Coastal Protection for Local Economic Activities from Hurricanes in the Caribbean,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/174441638210732041/pdf/Mangroves-as-Coastal-Protection-for-Local-Economic-Activities-from-Hurricanes-in-the-Caribbean.pdf,/research/2021/11/33648473/mangroves-coastal-protection-local-economic-activities-hurricanes-caribbean,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/174441638210732041/Mangroves-as-Coastal-Protection-for-Local-Economic-Activities-from-Hurricanes-in-the-Caribbean,174441638210732041,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/174441638210732041/Mangroves-as-Coastal-Protection-for-Local-Economic-Activities-from-Hurricanes-in-the-Caribbean,D33648473,31,2021/11/33648473/Mangroves-as-Coastal-Protection-for-Local-Economic-Activities-from-Hurricanes-in-the-Caribbean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Policy Research working paper,no.

The project will ensure a minimum navigable water depth during dry seasons, thus guaranteeing an uninterrupted flow of shipping and the reclassification of the river to a third class waterway accessible to 1000 ton barges. The anticipated environmental impacts assessed by this study are as follows. Location issues include: 1) inundation management and prevention; 2) socio-economic impacts; 3) flora and fauna; and 4) impact on cultural and historical properties. Construction issues include: 1) noise; 2) soil erosion and dust; 3) atmospheric pollution; 4) surface water pollution; 5) economic impacts of construction; and 6) public health. The principle impacts on the environment include disruption of areas adjacent to the project site, soil erosion, temporary water quality decline, and air quality degradation resulting from the construction process. Impacts to terrestrial and aquatic resources appear to be minimal since the project will be located on a highly regulated waterway and will not create significantly new conditions. Potential impacts may occur due to the large labor population which the project will attract and thirteen cultural and historic sites will be affected by inundation, necessitating protection measures and excavation in some cases.",China - Guigang Multi-Purpose Navigation Project : summary environmental impact assessment (Vol. 5) : Environmental action plan & environmental monitoring plan of the Guigang multi-purpose navigation project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/621771468215369854/pdf/multi-page.pdf,/projects/documents/1994/04/698466/china-guigang-multi-purpose-navigation-project-summary-environmental-impact-assessment-vol-5-environmental-action-plan-environmental-monitoring-plan-guigang-multi-purpose-navigation-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/621771468215369854/Environmental-action-plan-environmental-monitoring-plan-of-the-Guigang-multi-purpose-navigation-project,621771468215369854,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/621771468215369854/Environmental-action-plan-environmental-monitoring-plan-of-the-Guigang-multi-purpose-navigation-project,D698466,52,1994/04/698466/Environmental-action-plan-environmental-monitoring-plan-of-the-Guigang-multi-purpose-navigation-project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ports/Waterways,Sub-National Government","Infrastructure services for private sector development,Rural non-farm income generation","Financial and private sector development,Rural development",World,East Asia and Pacific,Asia,"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2",Waterways; Environmental impact assessment; Socioeconomic conditions; Flora; Fauna; Noise pollution; Soil erosion; Dust; Air pollution; Water pollution; Public health; Water quality; Air quality; Historic sites & monuments; Floods; Rivers; Organizational structure; Financial policy; Market economy; Navigation; Dams; Transport; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Economic development; Inland waterways; Poverty mitigation; Labor markets; Policy reform,,,,,

The event explored best practices in a variety of topics ranging from open source risk modeling to community-based risk assessments. New approaches in risk assessment were showcased, focusing on technological developments and the benefits of inclusive partnerships. The UR conference was attended by officials from government agencies, research institutions, multilateral organizations, private sector firms, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations involved in disaster risk assessment. Prior to the conference a series of on-line discussions on the session topics were led by experts in the field at the UR community site. The UR community site was built as a platform for experts and practitioners in disaster risk management to exchange ideas, share information, and discuss innovative risk assessment practices. UR was organized in conjunction with the outreach meeting of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) initiative.",Understanding risk : innovation in disaster risk assessment - proceeds from the 2010 UR forum,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/155131468149384709/pdf/639420WP0Under00Box0361533B0PUBLIC0.pdf,/research/2010/06/14893205/understanding-risk-innovation-disaster-risk-assessment-proceeds-2010-ur-forum,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/155131468149384709/Understanding-risk-innovation-in-disaster-risk-assessment-proceeds-from-the-2010-UR-forum,155131468149384709,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/155131468149384709/Understanding-risk-innovation-in-disaster-risk-assessment-proceeds-from-the-2010-UR-forum,D14893205,46,2010/06/14893205/understanding-risk-innovation-disaster-risk-assessment-proceeds-2010-ur-forum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But what exactly do we know This study systematically measures seasonal price gaps at 193 markets for 13 food commodities in seven African countries. It shows that the commonly used dummy variable or moving average deviation methods to estimate the seasonalgap can yield substantial upward bias. This can be partially circumvented using trigonometric and sawtooth models, which are more parsimonious. Among staple crops, seasonality is highest for maize (33 percent on average) and lowest for rice (16½ percent). This is two and a half to three times larger than in the international reference markets. Seasonality varies substantially across market places but maize isthe only crop in which there are important systematic country effects. Malawi, where maize is the main staple, emerges as exhibiting the most acute seasonal differences. Reaching the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger requires renewed policy attention to seasonality in food prices and consumption.",Food price seasonality in Africa : measurement and extent,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/339991518171216769/pdf/123197-JRN-PUBLIC-Food-price-seasonality-in-Africa.pdf,/research/2017/01/29577130/food-price-seasonality-africa-measurement-extent,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/339991518171216769/Food-price-seasonality-in-Africa-measurement-and-extent,339991518171216769,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/339991518171216769/Food-price-seasonality-in-Africa-measurement-and-extent,D29577130,14,2017/01/29577130/food-price-seasonality-africa-measurement-extent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Author accepted manuscript,,,,,,

The estimations indicate that the 1°C cooling experienced in the already cold highlands over the past five decades likely has reduced consumption possibilities by about 2-3 percent in these areas. Since the much richer population in the lowlands have benefitted slightly from recent climate change, the simulations suggest that recent climate change has contributed to an increase in inequality and poverty in Bolivia. Poor and indigenous peoples in the highlands are among the most severely affected populations. No statistically significant effect on life expectancy was found.","Social impacts of climate change in Bolivia : a municipal level analysis of the effects of recent climate change on life expectancy, consumption, poverty and inequality",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/285621468006309961/pdf/WPS5092.pdf,/research/2009/10/11253965/social-impacts-climate-change-bolivia-municipal-level-analysis-effects-recent-climate-change-life-expectancy-consumption-poverty-inequality,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/285621468006309961/Social-impacts-of-climate-change-in-Bolivia-a-municipal-level-analysis-of-the-effects-of-recent-climate-change-on-life-expectancy-consumption-poverty-and-inequality,285621468006309961,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/285621468006309961/Social-impacts-of-climate-change-in-Bolivia-a-municipal-level-analysis-of-the-effects-of-recent-climate-change-on-life-expectancy-consumption-poverty-and-inequality,D11253965,28,2009/10/11253965/Social-impacts-of-climate-change-in-Bolivia-a-municipal-level-analysis-of-the-effects-of-recent-climate-change-on-life-expectancy-consumption-poverty-and-inequality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Latin America & Caribbean,South America,World,Policy Research working paper ; no.

Following a uniform national lockdown, the Government of India classified all districts into three zones with varying containment measures in May 2020. Using a difference-in-differences approach, the paper estimates the impact of these restrictions on nighttime light intensity, a standard high-frequency proxy for economic activity. To conduct this analysis, pandemic-era, district-level data from a range of novel sources are combined -- monthly nighttime lights from global satellites; Facebook’s mobility data from individual smartphone locations; and high-frequency, household-level survey data on income and consumption, supplemented with data from the Indian Census and the Reserve Bank of India. The analysis finds that nighttime light intensity in May was 12.4 percent lower for districts with the most severe restrictions and 1.7 percent lower for districts with intermediate restrictions, compared with districts with the least restrictions. The differences were largest in May, when the different policies were in place, and slowly tapered in June and July. Restricted mobility and lower household income are plausible channels for these results. Stricter containment measures had larger impacts in districts with greater population density of older residents, as well as more services employment and bank credit.",Lights Out ?

Impacts can be found in the health sector, where labor productivity can be affected, in agriculture, where the quality and quantity of food produced can be reduced, and in tourism, real estate, aquaculture/fisheries and other sectors which rely on environmental quality and ecosystem services. Despite these well-known impacts, finding economy-wide affects of water quality on economic activity can be elusive. In this paper we attempt to fill this gap by using a conventional empirical approach in contemporary environmental economics and new data on economic activity and water quality for nineteen countries from 1990-2014. The authors find that when rivers become very heavily polluted, regions downstream see reductions in economic growth, losing between 0.8 and 2.0 percent of economic growth. These losses imply that in many places, the costs of environmental degradation are severely under-estimated and well above efficient levels.",The Impact of Water Quality on GDP Growth : Evidence from Around the World,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/656191576065317601/pdf/The-Impact-of-Water-Quality-on-GDP-Growth-Evidence-from-Around-the-World.pdf,/research/2019/12/31628315/impact-water-quality-gdp-growth-evidence-around-world,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/656191576065317601/The-Impact-of-Water-Quality-on-GDP-Growth-Evidence-from-Around-the-World,656191576065317601,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/656191576065317601/The-Impact-of-Water-Quality-on-GDP-Growth-Evidence-from-Around-the-World,D31628315,19,2019/12/31628315/,"Zaveri,Esha Dilip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survey data present a large, rich, highly disaggregated information source that is trialed and tested to the specifications of smallholder agriculture common in low- and middle-income countries. However, to tap into this potential, a thorough understanding of and robust methodology for measuring disaster crop production losses in survey microdata is essential. This paper exploits plot-level panel data for almost 20,000 plots on 8,000 farms in three Sub-Saharan African countries with information on harvest, input use, and different proxies of losses; household and community-level data; as well data from other sources such as crop cutting and survey experiments, to provide new insights into the reliability of survey-based crop loss estimates and their attribution to disasters. The paper concludes with concrete recommendations for methodology and survey design and identifies key avenues for further research.",Measuring Disaster Crop Production Losses Using Survey Microdata : Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/324181647280329139/pdf/Measuring-Disaster-Crop-Production-Losses-Using-Survey-Microdata-Evidence-from-Sub-Saharan-Africa.pdf,/research/2022/03/33757861/measuring-disaster-crop-production-losses-using-survey-microdata-evidence-sub-saharan-africa,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/324181647280329139/Measuring-Disaster-Crop-Production-Losses-Using-Survey-Microdata-Evidence-from-Sub-Saharan-Africa,324181647280329139,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/324181647280329139/Measuring-Disaster-Crop-Production-Losses-Using-Survey-Microdata-Evidence-from-Sub-Saharan-Africa,D33757861,62,2022/03/33757861/Measuring-Disaster-Crop-Production-Losses-Using-Survey-Microdata-Evidence-from-Sub-Saharan-Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Policy Research working paper,no.

Established with the support of UNDP and bilateral official donors in 1983, ESMAP is managed by the World Bank. ESMAP's mission is to promote the role of energy in poverty reduction and economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner. Its work applies to low-income, emerging, and transition economies and contributes to the achievement of internationally agreed development goals. ESMAP interventions are knowledge products including free technical assistance specific studies advisory services, pilot projects, knowledge generation and dissemination, trainings; workshops and seminars, conferences and roundtables, and publications. ESMAP work is focused on three priority areas: access to modem energy for the poorest, the development of sustainable energy markets, and the promotion of environmentally sustainable energy practices. ESMAP has supported a number of energy trade programs, but so far feedback from these projects and evaluations of the knowledge gained has been limited. It was therefore decided to undertake a review ESMAP's portfolio of projects related to the international trade of energy. This review was to include not only those projects that have been completed, but also those that currently are under way, and those that are in the immediate pipeline. The review was guided by the technical advisory group to the energy trust funded programs located at the World Bank.",Evaluation of ESMAP regional power trade portfolio,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/538971467987845788/pdf/102610-ESMAP-Box394839B-PUBLIC-59.pdf,/research/2004/12/25767061/evaluation-esmap-regional-power-trade-portfolio,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/538971467987845788/Evaluation-of-ESMAP-regional-power-trade-portfolio,538971467987845788,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/538971467987845788/Evaluation-of-ESMAP-regional-power-trade-portfolio,D25767061,140,2004/12/25767061/evaluation-esmap-regional-power-trade-portfolio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) technical paper,no. 059",,,,,,

Main concerns are with glaciers, snow, permafrost, and related cold climate conditions. These are increasingly important as resources, but also in potentially large problems related to climate change and development plans. A primary goal of this inquiry is to identify and assess existing capacities, data sources, and projects on-going, or in the pipeline. The report begins with an updated over view of the scope and status of Bhutan’s cryosphere in section one. It draws attention to the science behind cryosphere phenomena, the (unsatisfactory) state of knowledge of the Himalayan cryosphere, and on-going debates about that. Cryosphere hazards are addressed, how they arise, and possible impacts of climate change on them. In keeping with integrated water management, a multi-hazards approach is presented, to extend and balance the exceptional work to date on glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Bhutan’s relevant, existing capacities are then reviewed in relation to the cryosphere in section two. It continues to rely heavily on other units, outside assistance, and ad hoc initiatives. Some personnel are engaged in GLOFs program and in pilot glacier observing projects. Outside Cryosphere Service Division (CSD) there seems to be very limited awareness of cryosphere components, even those that clearly enter the concerns of other agencies.",Resilience in a Changing Climate Cryosphere Monitoring and Management in Bhutan : Technical Note,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/707161546581166989/pdf/Bhutan-Cryosphere-Monitoring-Study-Sept-4-2018.pdf,/projects/documents/2018/08/30713091/resilience-changing-climate-cryosphere-monitoring-management-bhutan-technical-note,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/707161546581166989/Resilience-in-a-Changing-Climate-Cryosphere-Monitoring-and-Management-in-Bhutan-Technical-Note,707161546581166989,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/707161546581166989/Resilience-in-a-Changing-Climate-Cryosphere-Monitoring-and-Management-in-Bhutan-Technical-Note,D30713091,50,2018/08/30713091/resilience-changing-climate-cryosphere-monitoring-management-bhutan-technical-note,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other Public Administration,Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management","Regional integration,Climate change,Natural disaster management","Trade and integration,Environment and natural resource management,Social protection and risk management",,,,,,,,,,

The project's complex nature, involving a large number of subprojects, was of high risk, yet experimental, which generated useful lessons. In the field of horticulture, it is suggested that given the constraints in promoting an horticultural organization for exporting purposes, given it cannot be financially self sustaining in the short run, a policy decision should be made - sustained with public funds - but with a sound criteria that such funds are to sustain only the initial stage, and, guidelines should be developed for service user charges, for commercial purposes, and, to balance between expertise in production, and marketing in staff skills of such an organization. Regarding partnership programs, initiatives need further simplification, through community contracting procedures, to build in flexibility in dealing with local issues, and, a sustainable financing mechanism through leveraging funds from other sources, could be explored to sustain successful activities. Finally, concerning pilot subprojects, the increased awareness on the benefits of soil testing should be explored, particularly through private sector participation, in the provision of cost-effective portable, soil testing facilities.",Bangladesh - Agricultural Services Innovation and Reform Project,,/projects/documents/2003/09/2521577/bangladesh-agricultural-services-innovation-reform-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/815011468768680770/Bangladesh-Agricultural-Services-Innovation-and-Reform-Project,815011468768680770,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/815011468768680770/Bangladesh-Agricultural-Services-Innovation-and-Reform-Project,D2521577,,2003/09/2521577/bangladesh-agricultural-services-innovation-reform-project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agricultural Extension, Research, and Other Support Activities,Irrigation and Drainage,Central Government (Central Agencies),Agricultural markets, commercialization and agri-business",,,World,Asia,South Asia,,Special Program for Food Security;rural services and infrastructure;cost recovery for services;Export Development and Competitiveness;extension of closing date;agricultural extension and research;learning and innovation loan;quality at entry;crop yield forecasting;financial management capacity;soil fertility management;soil testing;agricultural technology transfer;principal performance ratings;income generating activity;on-farm water management;high value commodity;readiness for implementation;extension service;horticultural export;allocation of resource;partnerships with ngos;transfer of knowledge;lack of resource;delay in procurement;devolution of responsibility;procurement of equipment;lack of commitment;early warning system;capacity utilization rate;market entry strategy;department of agriculture;institutional development impact;Integrated Pest Management;release of fund;knowledge transfer partnership;water management initiative;technical assistance service;financial management improvement;historical meteorological data;participation of stakeholder;engine of growth;receipt of money;private sector entrepreneur;supply chain management;fruit and vegetable;business development plan;cost of service;irrigation and drainage;cost recovery basis;project performance indicator;quality control measure;female extension workers;horticulture export;pilot program;agricultural service;contract farming;crop production;farmer;partnership program;horticultural production;export activity;external market;partnership activity;agriculture technology;government fund;payment order;project costing;marketing expertise;extension program;counterpart fund;subsidized rate;participatory approach;market issues;partnership development;extension approach;private entrepreneur;rural area;audit observations;procurement arrangement;public fund;inadequate transparency;horticulture product;gender equity;market intelligence;yield data;rural employment;ring fenced;emergency operation;competitive grant;raw data;marketing research;project impact;institutional model;extensive consultation;institutional strengthening;government control;catastrophic flood;agricultural sector;appraisal mission;sustainable partnership;small grants;chemical residues;consulting service;meteorology department;macro policies;macro policy;agricultural economist;extension method;fertilizer practice;government units;fertilizer cost;contracting procedure;sustainable financing;financially self;partnership contract;agricultural production;Consulting services;extension activity;national shopping;institutional risk;civil works;food transfer;farm family;impact indicator;export logistic;farmers uses;primary author;production base;weather forecast;Technology Diffusion;participatory need;logistical support;market opportunity;local farming;irrigation equipment;refrigerated vehicle;logistical services;fruit tree;participatory appraisal;women's issue;competitive selection;institutional cooperation;program development;poor household;transparent mechanism;irrigation channel;crop cultivation;fertilizer application;organic manure;vegetable cultivation;funded component;agricultural marketing;output targets;private company;female farmer;competitive basis;demonstration programs;extension methodologies;program finance;financial benefit;agribusiness sector;rural policy;post harvest;production parameters;conventional investment;institutional mechanism;pilot activities;public support;monitoring progress;positive outcome;quantitative targets;marketing skills;advance payment;food planning;information campaign;agricultural productivity;paradigm shift;technical expertise;project intervention;local network;credit proceeds;stakeholder analysis;institutional aspect;block allocation;fund activity;administrative level;proper packaging;local representatives;government support;transition arrangement;regular operations;increased partnership;sustainability rating;water saving;commercial term;analytical equipment;small farmer,,,,,

This environmental assessment identifies environmental risks connected with the project, and discusses measures to mitigate them. Suggestions are as follows. Minimize dust emissions from land clearing, from drilling and blasting and ground excavation, as well as due to facility construction, and from equipment traffic over temporary roads at the construction site, by using the following methods: Cover stockpiled material with suitable sheet material; sprinkle water on construction areas, and access roads; limit vehicle speed, cover vehicles, and maintain equipment and machinery. Mix ash with gypsum, to be conveyed to mining disposal area. Treat wastewaters from construction areas prior to its discharge to river bodies, and, monitor groundwater quality. Solid wastes, medical and oily wastes, hazardous wastes (such as used batteries, bitumen, cables, copper, fire-fighting foam, adhesives, general chemicals, acids, oil rags and absorbents, solvents, contaminated soils, insulation, paint sludge, used oil and paint cans and drums etc.) should be packaged to be collected in black bags, separated from medical, hazardous, dangerous and packaged wastes. Separately collected domestic wastes will be transported to a temporary waste storage center or container, by special vehicles to be stored separately. Store those recyclable wastes in separate closed containers. Segregate paper, cardboards, plastics and metal packaged wastes according to their type, to be collected in blue bags. Handle other, including hazardous and medical, waste according to regulations. To control noise, restrict hours of operation, and ensure vehicle noise does not exceed permitted levels. To minimize industrial accidents, train personnel in health and safety issues, have workers wear protective equipment, set up a health center on site, and use fire prevention measures.",Turkey - Energy Liberalization Project : environmental assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/699451468174238273/pdf/E1307.pdf,/projects/documents/2006/05/6791054/turkey-energy-liberalization-project-environmental-assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/699451468174238273/Turkey-Energy-Liberalization-Project-environmental-assessment,699451468174238273,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/699451468174238273/Turkey-Energy-Liberalization-Project-environmental-assessment,D6791054,332,2006/05/6791054/Turkey-Energy-Liberalization-Project-environmental-assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Power,,,Asia,Eastern Europe,Europe,,,Middle East,World,,,

However many countries do not have high quality, publicly available data on renewable energy resource potential and this limits the potential for informed policy development, including zoning guidance, transmission network planning, and price regulation or incentives. It also narrows the field of potential commercial developers, and raises the cost of undertaking preliminary site identification and financial analyses. This report draws on many years of experience within the World Bank Group and among other development partners in carrying out renewable energy resource assessment and mapping at the country level, in particular from 12 projects funded by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) under a major global initiative launched in 2012.

However, as detailed engineering designs of the Free Zone development plans were not yet available, it was not possible to obtain a full description of each element, thus this environmental assessment (EA), and social management plan (SMP) focus on the construction, and operation phases regarding road works, building of factory, and offices, land acquisition, as well as land impacts as a result of construction, particularly water supply, sewage treatment, and solid waste collection. During construction, water spraying surfaces should prevent dusting; preventive measures will be specified to reduce accidental spills, and/or negative impacts on groundwater quality, reducing as well adversity on soil quality, in addition to runoff water contamination; and, a buffer zone of at least 200 meters, should border industrial vs. residential areas, while vegetation propagation should reduce noise, and air pollution. During operation, emission standards, and regulation enforcement should be developed, including monitoring criteria; similarly, effluent discharge standards, and quality control should be developed, to include monitoring of groundwater quality. Further mitigation measures address preventive actions for flora, and fauna protection, cultural heritage protection, and precautions to safeguard marine, and coastal resources.

Negative measures includes: loss of trees and crops, loss of income, loss of asset, loss of land acquisition, and loss of livelihood. Mitigation measures include: a) in absence of advance notice, cash compensation based on annual value of the produce and calculated according to the Department of Agriculture norms (crop compensation); b) if affected land is under tenancy, both the landowners and tenants will be treated as affected people and will be eligible for entitlements and compensation. Rehabilitation measures for restoration of the livelihood of Social Protection Administration Program (SPAP) will be devised under the subproject implementation plan; c) the effected people will get priority in employment during project construction works and other project activities; d) if possible, provide 'land for land' particularly to the vulnerable groups.

The project will also include the construction of a transmission system consisting of lines and extension of substations as well as the transfer and storage of Naphtha. Transfer of Naphtha has some potential impact, mitigated by: rail transport safety management audits; emergency shut off valves for unloading; storage alarm system and safety audits; and regular pipeline patrols. Construction and operation may impact minimally on: water quality, air quality, ecology (terrestrial and aquatic), noise levels, demography and socio-economics. The study further looked at dredging and found no significant environmental impact and air quality should be within regulatory levels.

It provides guidance on the role and benefits of forecasting as a cost-effective operational solution to manage the uncertainty of VRE generation and facilitate the integration of larger shares of these resources in the energy mix. The guide focuses primarily on the types of forecasting methods and how physical and statistical models are used for developing short- to long-term forecasts. Technological advances in weather forecasting, together with better data on historical performance of renewable energy, allow significantly improved forecasting accuracy of VRE generation, which results in more efficient utilization. Examples from developing countries illustrate how the approach to forecasting varies depending on the country’s electricity market structure and requirements.",Using Forecasting Systems to Reduce Cost and Improve Dispatch of Variable Renewable Energy,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/764421562863079220/pdf/Using-Forecasting-Systems-to-Reduce-Cost-and-Improve-Dispatch-of-Variable-Renewable-Energy.pdf,/research/2019/07/31241710/using-forecasting-systems-reduce-cost-improve-dispatch-variable-renewable-energy,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/764421562863079220/Using-Forecasting-Systems-to-Reduce-Cost-and-Improve-Dispatch-of-Variable-Renewable-Energy,764421562863079220,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/764421562863079220/Using-Forecasting-Systems-to-Reduce-Cost-and-Improve-Dispatch-of-Variable-Renewable-Energy,D31241710,38,2019/07/31241710/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Renewable Energy Geothermal,Renewable Energy Biomass,Energy Transmission and Distribution,Renewable Energy Wind,Renewable Energy Solar","Other environment and natural resources management,Climate change,Land administration and management",Environment and natural resource management,,,,Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP),,,,,,

The estimation strategy takes advantage of the geographical variation in the implementation of different project components and is based on a combination of remote-sensing (satellite) data and national household survey data. The results suggest that a combination of demand-side and supply-side interventions was associated with a statistically significant increase in electricity access, a decrease in the frequency of blackouts, and a switch from traditional fuels to electricity as the main source of energy for lighting (but not for cooking). At the same time, there is no evidence that the intervention caused households to pay more for electricity. The results are consistent with an emerging view in the literature that there are synergies between energy efficiency and energy access, especially in places where the bottleneck to wider electricity access is limited electricity generation capacity rather than the cost of connecting more clients to the grid.",Impacts of Energy Efficiency Projects in Developing Countries : Evidence from a Spatial Difference-in-Differences Analysis in Malawi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/360541636133634224/pdf/Impacts-of-Energy-Efficiency-Projects-in-Developing-Countries-Evidence-from-a-Spatial-Difference-in-Differences-Analysis-in-Malawi.pdf,/research/2021/11/33588073/impacts-energy-efficiency-projects-developing-countries-evidence-spatial-difference-in-differences-analysis-malawi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/360541636133634224/Impacts-of-Energy-Efficiency-Projects-in-Developing-Countries-Evidence-from-a-Spatial-Difference-in-Differences-Analysis-in-Malawi,360541636133634224,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/360541636133634224/Impacts-of-Energy-Efficiency-Projects-in-Developing-Countries-Evidence-from-a-Spatial-Difference-in-Differences-Analysis-in-Malawi,D33588073,19,2021/11/33588073/Impacts-of-Energy-Efficiency-Projects-in-Developing-Countries-Evidence-from-a-Spatial-Difference-in-Differences-Analysis-in-Malawi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Southern Africa,World,Sub-Saharan Africa,"Policy Research working paper,no.

Some lessons learned included: the clean development mechanism (CDM) registration and issuance process needs to be simplified and streamlined in order to ensure that transaction costs are minimized, and cash flows are predictable. The revenue stream from the carbon credits was insufficient to make-or-break the investment. One way to provide more value-added from the CF instrument is by making upfront payments. Since the investors do not see revenue from forestry projects for 20 years or more, upfront payments can help to smooth cash flow and help the investors pay for maintenance and other costs in the early years of the project. While, in the case of precious woods, the project entity (PE) declined this option, in other operations this payment option can be valuable to investors. Project teams are advised to take extra care in defining and regularly supervising the project area and conduct due diligence with a team that comprises all relevant experts, especially in cases where social or environmental issues are identified or can exist.

For each resource identified in the environmental and social baselines, the Project development activities are briefly described within the context of each resource. The potential impacts are then predicted based on the perceived direct impact that the Project overlay will have on that resource. Engineering controls and mitigation measures are then identified for implementation in order to reduce the identified impact to acceptable levels. Among the issues that represent the key mitigation action items to address are air quality, noise, visual resources, topography and land forms, geology, soils, surface water, groundwater, flora, fauna, aquatic resources, cultural resources, land and natural resource use, livelihood activities and employment opportunities, population, public health and safety, and infrastructure services and cultural property. The report groups the impacts by significant major topic and proposes the following mitigations: 1) Reduce impacts to nearby neighbors by implementing specific safety program and controlling noise, dust, vibration, and night-time light; 2) Reduce impacts to downstream water supplies by controlling surface water base flow and quality impacts as well as the quality and quantity of available groundwater; Reduce impacts to Project employees and visitors by promoting worker health and safety and maintaining a clean and safe work environment, limiting occupational exposure to risks, and adequately managing wastes and emergency situations; 3) Reduce impacts resulting from land use changes by implementing an effective closure and reclamation program that re-establishes the land to an appropriate post-mining land use; 4) Reduce impacts to resettled households by implementing livelihood restoration programs, food security, and, to the extent practical and secure, the availability of agricultural land; and 5) Reduce impacts to local communities by promoting economic diversification, controlling job-seeker influx and demands on infrastructure, and limiting physical hazards and the effects of social evils to the extent possible.",Vietnam - Nui Phao Mining Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 2) : Environmental and social impact assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/948271468125973677/pdf/E14311Vol1021ESIA.pdf,/projects/documents/2006/06/6981122/vietnam-nui-phao-mining-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-environmental-social-impact-assessment,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/948271468125973677/Environmental-and-social-impact-assessment,948271468125973677,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/948271468125973677/Environmental-and-social-impact-assessment,D6981122,975,2006/06/6981122/Environmental-and-social-impact-assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,General finance sector,,,World,Southeast Asia,Asia,,,,,,,

Reuse of treated sewage to fertilize the microbial food chain for aquaculture presents one of the most economic resource recovery options for cities in developing countries. With that in mind, this study examines wastewater-based fish and prawn culture research development and demonstration efforts conducted in Lima, Peru. In this study, fish and prawns were cultured in wastewater stabilization lagoons operating as polishing lagoons in series with primary and secondary ponds. It was found that the environmental conditions in the ponds were satisfactory for the survival and growth of tilapia and carps, particularly in the cycle-end polishing ponds. However, more research regarding this topic (i.e. a demonstration project) will follow to clarify missing parameters from this research and to elaborate on the health and economic aspects of this study.","Aquaculture with treated wastewater : a status report on studies conducted in Lima, Peru",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/926381468294119119/pdf/TEC3000Aquacul0ducted0in0Lima00Peru.pdf,/research/1987/01/1554636/aquaculture-treated-wastewater-status-report-studies-conducted-lima-peru,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/926381468294119119/Aquaculture-with-treated-wastewater-a-status-report-on-studies-conducted-in-Lima-Peru,926381468294119119,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/926381468294119119/Aquaculture-with-treated-wastewater-a-status-report-on-studies-conducted-in-Lima-Peru,D1554636,69,1987/01/1554636/aquaculture-treated-wastewater-status-report-studies-conducted-lima-peru,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fisheries,,,World,South America,Latin America & Caribbean,Applied Research and Technology (WUDAT) technical note ; no. 3 -- Integrated Resource Recovery Project,Aquaculture; Sewage; Fish; Prawns,,,,,

The evidence suggests that climate change could have a negative impact on poverty by 2030. The paper proposes a two-stage least squares regression where it first regresses temperature and rainfall (along with geographic controls and state and year fixed effects) on municipal gross domestic product per capita for 2000 and 2005 The resulting gross domestic product per capita is used in a second equation to estimate municipal poverty on the same years. The authors then incorporate projections of temperature and rainfall changes by 2030 into the estimated climate-gross domestic product coefficients to assess the effects of climate change in economic activity and how this in turn will influence poverty. At the same time, they account for the potential adaptive capacity of municipalities through higher population densities and economic growth. Both would reduce poverty by 31.72 percentage points between 2005 and 2030 with changing climate. However, poverty could have been reduced up to 34.15 percentage points over the same period had there been no climate change. This suggests that climate change slows down the pace of poverty reduction. An alternative reading is that poverty is expected to increase from 15.25 percent (without climate change) to 17.68 percent (with climate change) by 2030. Given the existing population projections for 2030, this represents 2,902,868 people remaining in poverty as a result of climate change.",The poverty impact of climate change in Mexico,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/737741468278743350/pdf/WPS6461.pdf,/research/2013/05/17751206/poverty-impact-climate-change-mexico,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/737741468278743350/The-poverty-impact-of-climate-change-in-Mexico,737741468278743350,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/737741468278743350/The-poverty-impact-of-climate-change-in-Mexico,D17751206,23,2013/05/17751206/The-poverty-impact-of-climate-change-in-Mexico,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Latin America & Caribbean,North America,World,Policy Research working paper ; no.

Adverse impacts include loss of forest land which is not attached to any designated natural habitat; loss of agriculture land; change in land use pattern; high hill cuttings which could lead to safety hazards; generation of huge amount of spoil; land slide risk zones; blasting of rocks which could lead to safety and slide hazards if not done scientifically; loss of graveyards if alternative alignments are not put in place; soil erosion; air and water pollution; noise pollution; and loss of water harvesting structures. Measures such as limiting slope while cutting the hill side; appropriate disposal mechanisms for debris and waste materials; controlled blasting of rocks; compensatory forestation; limited construction so as not to obstruct water sources; and conservation of water sources, are suggested to minimize or avoid these adversities.","India - Second Mizoram State Roads Regional Transport Connectivity Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 5) : Environmental impact assessment : widening to second lane, re-alignment and geometric improvement of Champhai-Zokhawthar road (00.000 km to 27.247 km)",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/941621468049872601/pdf/E44390V50REV0E00Box382157B00PUBLIC0.pdf,/projects/documents/2014/02/19098004/india-second-mizoram-state-roads-regional-transport-connectivity-project-environmental-assessment-vol-5-environmental-impact-assessment-widening-second-lane-re-alignment-geometric-improvement-champhai-zokhawthar-road-00000-km-27247-km,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/941621468049872601/Environmental-impact-assessment-widening-to-second-lane-re-alignment-and-geometric-improvement-of-Champhai-Zokhawthar-road-00-000-km-to-27-247-km,941621468049872601,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/941621468049872601/Environmental-impact-assessment-widening-to-second-lane-re-alignment-and-geometric-improvement-of-Champhai-Zokhawthar-road-00-000-km-to-27-247-km,D19098004,211,2014/02/19098004/india-second-mizoram-state-roads-regional-transport-connectivity-project-environmental-assessment-vol-5-6-environmental-impact-assessment-widening-second-lane-re-alignment-geometric-improvement-champhai-zokhawthar-road-00000-km-27247-km,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rural and Inter-Urban Roads,Trade","Trade facilitation and market access,Rural services and infrastructure","Trade and integration,Rural development",World,South Asia,Asia,,,,,,,

In this context, The World Bank and the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport (AASTMT) agreed on establishing a partnership for conducting the study on “Climate Change Adaptation and Natural Disaster Preparedness in Greater Alexandria”, tobe part of the above mentioned regional study. The World Bank has dedicated to this study the international expertise of the consortium members that include IAU-IDF and BRGM led by Egis BCEOM International.The present report deals with the Greater Alexandria region. Following the diagnosis produced during the first phase of the study, the purpose here is to develop an adaptation and resilience action plan for natural disasters and climate change. The first phase report included a comprehensive analysis of the different natural and socioeconomic systems and characteristics of Alexandria. It covered risk assessment in the current situation and in 2030. A list of new vulnerabilities was also identified and spatially allocated on a map. In summary, the first phase report pinpointed the following main issues that need priority actions and immediate interventions in order to increase the city preparedness towards possible climate change risks and disasters: The city is built on a narrow and partially elevated coastal ridge facing the sea and is exposed to marine submersion, coastal erosion, earthquake, flooding and water scarcity risks.Compared to the current situation, disaster risks are expected to worsen by 2030 due to climate change, and continuing urban expansion in new sites exposed to natural hazards.The city may face higher marine submersion, coastal erosion and water scarcity risks, along with an increase in seismic, land subsidence, and flooding risks. Additionally, climate changes may negatively affect public health. While natural risks are growing, the institutional capacity in Alexandria to manage these risks and prepare communities for potential future disasters and climate change impact islimited. The current organizational set-up of the emergency response systems remain highly centralized with limited coordination between agencies horizontally and vertically down to the level of communities.",Climate change adaptation and natural disasters preparedness in the coastal cities of North Africa : phase 2 : adaptation and resilience action plan –alexandria area,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/605381501489019613/pdf/117790-WP-PUBLIC-Alexandria-PHASE-2-ENGLISH.pdf,/research/2011/05/27865492/climate-change-adaptation-natural-disasters-preparedness-coastal-cities-north-africa-phase-2-adaptation-resilience-action-plan-–alexandria-area,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/605381501489019613/phase-2-adaptation-and-resilience-action-plan-alexandria-area,605381501489019613,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/605381501489019613/phase-2-adaptation-and-resilience-action-plan-alexandria-area,D27865492,162,2017/07/27865492/climate-change-adaptation-natural-disasters-preparedness-coastal-cities-north-africa-phase-2-adaptation-resilience-action-plan-alexandria-area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of the World Bank Water Anchor's analytical and advisory work on water and climate change, consultants have investigated how private sector services to infrastructure may address the challenges related to climate change while, at the same time, improving development opportunities for people. This report, which is one of the outcomes of the work, addresses the role of private providers of non-financial climate change-related services with relevance for water infrastructure. This report investigates to need for additional services with regard to climate change and analyzes the potential for the private sector in providing these services. The analysis focuses on the water sectors likely to be affected by climate change, that is, water resources management, irrigation and drainage, hydropower, coastal protection, flood protection, urban water supply, and sanitation as well as water quality. In addition, opportunities for mutual engagement of public and private agencies are analyzed and the perspectives of market development are explored. The central aim of the report is to deepen our understanding of the opportunities for engaging private providers of climate change services in climate change adaptation combined with socioeconomic development opportunities.",Private providers of climate change services : the role and scope for the private sector in the provision of non-financial climate change-related services relevant to water infrastructure,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/340611468336293215/pdf/555710NWP0WN2610Box349455B01PUBLIC1.pdf,/research/2010/06/12514810/private-providers-climate-change-services-role-scope-private-sector-provision-non-financial-climate-change-related-services-relevant-water-infrastructure,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/340611468336293215/Private-providers-of-climate-change-services-the-role-and-scope-for-the-private-sector-in-the-provision-of-non-financial-climate-change-related-services-relevant-to-water-infrastructure,340611468336293215,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/340611468336293215/Private-providers-of-climate-change-services-the-role-and-scope-for-the-private-sector-in-the-provision-of-non-financial-climate-change-related-services-relevant-to-water-infrastructure,D12514810,44,2010/06/12514810/private-providers-climate-change-services-role-scope-private-sector-provision-non-financial-climate-change-related-services-relevant-water-infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Water working notes ; no. 26,,,,,,

The study covers four areas, namely: the Dar es Salaam, Iringa, Tabora - Mwanga and the Arusha woodfuel catchment areas. Details of these areas are presented in this report. The areas covered by this study are important woodfuel target areas for either urban supply, the tobacco industry or both. The production of satellite image maps and vegetation type map overlays in this project is a prelminary step for a woody biomass inventory of the areas concerned. This inventory involves limited destructive sampling using the regression equations so established. Details of species composition for the different land cover types will also be generated. The information accumulating from all these tasks will form the basis for systematic programs to upgrade the management of the peri-urban woodfuel sources and those in the tobacco growing areas. This report is concerned with the production of vegetation type maps with particular emphasis on those which are sources and potential sources of woodfuels.",Mapping of woodfuel resources in Tanzania using spot satellite data,,/research/1990/12/700111/mapping-woodfuel-resources-tanzania-using-spot-satellite-data,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/776801468760799740/Mapping-of-woodfuel-resources-in-Tanzania-using-spot-satellite-data,776801468760799740,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/776801468760799740/Mapping-of-woodfuel-resources-in-Tanzania-using-spot-satellite-data,D700111,,1990/12/700111/mapping-woodfuel-resources-tanzania-using-spot-satellite-data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(Historic)Other fuels,,,World,Middle East and North Africa,Sub-Saharan Africa,Energy Sector Management Assistance Program,Fuelwood; Solid fuels; Cartography; Biomass energy; Energy management,,,,,

Impacts from location include changes in gravity flow irrigation, a rise in the water table, extensive deforestation, and improper road drainage systems. To mitigate these impacts, raise the height of roads to prevent contamination, establish deep cut drains, pave the shoulders to keep them free from vegetative growth, and restrain truckers from overloading. Impacts due to road design will be alleviated as follows: to arrest traffic pollution, absorb noise, and provide an alternative fuel source, trees will be replanted on roadsides. During construction borrow pits will be restored and dressed to create a slope consistent with the level of adjoining land. Maintaining earthen drains and limiting construction activities for bridges and culverts to the dry season will help reduce soil quality deterioration and the resulting water pollution. Disposing of solid and liquid wastes, and stream courses and drainage will help maintain water quality. To control dust, asphalt and hot mix plants will be located away from inhabited areas; trucks will be covered; and machinery and equipment will be maintained. During the operational phase, emission checks will reduce pollution, planting will help prevent surface run-off, and accidents involving hazardous cargo will be offset by an emergency response system.",India - Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 13) : EIA and EMP summary (revised) for phase II Bijapur By-pass,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/908491468042558459/pdf/E4210VOL1013.pdf,/projects/documents/2005/01/5754691/india-karnataka-state-highways-improvement-project-environmental-assessment-vol-13-eia-emp-summary-revised-phase-ii-bijapur-by-pass,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/908491468042558459/EIA-and-EMP-summary-revised-for-phase-II-Bijapur-By-pass,908491468042558459,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/908491468042558459/EIA-and-EMP-summary-revised-for-phase-II-Bijapur-By-pass,D5754691,159,2005/01/5754691/EIA-and-EMP-summary-revised-for-phase-II-Bijapur-By-pass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Roads and highways,Central Government (Central Agencies)",,,World,South Asia,Asia,,construction and operation;project road;mitigation measure;public consultation;land acquisition;ambient air quality;suspend particulate;adverse environmental impact;urban development;air monitoring;resettlement and rehabilitation;displacement of persons;electricity and communication;number of accidents;corridor of impact;water quality standard;road safety measure;number of vehicles;species of plant;polluter pays principle;responsibility in matters;implementation of mitigation;flora and fauna;resettlement action plan;Environmental Management Plan;environmental survey;reconnaissance survey;noise level;baseline data;Environmental Assessment;environmental component;construction work;baseline conditions;environmental aspect;railway line;environmental mitigation;pollution load;regulatory perspective;compensatory measure;religious sites;cultural site;local utility;public health;impact analysis;traffic movement;environmental monitoring;Dry land;commercial vehicle;legal procedure;budgetary allocation;geographical location;primary data;study area;engineering design;compensatory afforestation;record keeping;road maintenance;environmental pollution;monitoring stations;plant species;civil engineer;construction activities;field observation;road improvement;cultural aspects;aesthetic value;environmental issue;wide swath;rehabilitation contracts;sanitary facility;engineering consultant;public road;journey time;Population Density;occupational structure;positive outcome;legal provision;work force;highway engineer;soil quality;biological resource;social forestry;traffic speed;embankment height;occupation pattern;educational institution;medical facility;basic amenity;religious structure;town development;tourist attraction;test result;construction phase;noise data;ambient noise;Industrial Goods;policy statement;agricultural land;black soil;commercial zone;domestic effluent;minimum period;flat terrain;pollution abatement;garbage dump;liquid waste;local resident;environment management;living creature;local ngo;consultancy service;road design;employment opportunities;employment opportunity;community representative;nesting sites;human impact;drainage structure;Cultural Heritage;tourist spots;water source;anthropogenic activity;environmental process;building material;social criterion;environmental features;accident rate;meteorological data;demographic data;land use;natural environment;embankment slopes;soil erosion;cultural property;social component;cultural environment;private owner;environmental sensitivity;commercial areas;opinion survey;environmental design;present study;socioeconomic survey;environmental enhancement;railway track;water resource;positive impact;road sign;rumble strip;civil engineering;standard design;indirect impact;local populace;field testing;secondary data;archaeological site;wildlife sanctuary;environmental condition;reserve forest;mitigative measure;water bodies;bore well;institutional strengthening;important component;contract specification;noise pollution;social aspect;contract clause;climatic condition;relative humidity;atmospheric temperature;project costing;tube wells;hand pump;open well;,,,,,

Impacts from location include changes in gravity flow irrigation, a rise in the water table, extensive deforestation, and improper road drainage systems. To mitigate these impacts, raise the height of roads to prevent contamination, establish deep cut drains, pave the shoulders to keep them free from vegetative growth, and restrain truckers from overloading. Impacts due to road design will be alleviated as follows: to arrest traffic pollution, absorb noise, and provide an alternative fuel source, trees will be replanted on roadsides. During construction borrow pits will be restored and dressed to create a slope consistent with the level of adjoining land. Maintaining earthen drains and limiting construction activities for bridges and culverts to the dry season will help reduce soil quality deterioration and the resulting water pollution. Disposing of solid and liquid wastes, and stream courses and drainage will help maintain water quality. To control dust, asphalt and hot mix plants will be located away from inhabited areas; trucks will be covered; and machinery and equipment will be maintained. During the operational phase, emission checks will reduce pollution, planting will help prevent surface run-off, and accidents involving hazardous cargo will be offset by an emergency response system.",India - Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 12) : EIA and EMP summary (revised) for phase II Raichur By-pass,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/296011468258573764/pdf/E4210VOL1012.pdf,/projects/documents/2005/01/5754836/india-karnataka-state-highways-improvement-project-environmental-assessment-vol-12-eia-emp-summary-revised-phase-ii-raichur-by-pass,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/296011468258573764/EIA-and-EMP-summary-revised-for-phase-II-Raichur-By-pass,296011468258573764,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/296011468258573764/EIA-and-EMP-summary-revised-for-phase-II-Raichur-By-pass,D5754836,188,2005/01/5754836/EIA-and-EMP-summary-revised-for-phase-II-Raichur-By-pass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Roads and highways,Central Government (Central Agencies)",,,World,South Asia,Asia,,construction and operation;project road;ambient air quality;mitigation measure;suspend particulate;adverse environmental impact;flora and fauna;labor-based construction;land acquisition process;responsibility in matters;development of forest;amounts of compensation;number of accidents;pollution control board;amount of land;payment of compensation;polluter pays principle;electricity and communication;corridor of impact;noise monitoring location;resettlement and rehabilitation;number of vehicles;poor road condition;water quality standard;municipal water supply;loss of livelihood;displacement of persons;resettlement action plan;public consultation;construction work;reconnaissance survey;environmental survey;noise level;environmental component;environmental aspect;pollution load;Environmental Assessment;baseline data;baseline conditions;environmental monitoring;regulatory perspective;legal procedure;water pollution;impact analysis;Legal responsibility;budgetary allocation;marginal land;traffic movement;compensatory measure;private land;Dry land;public hearing;ambient noise;engineering design;environmental mitigation;standard design;primary data;displaced person;cultural site;road development;embankment height;environmental issue;sanitary facility;wide swath;work force;cultural aspects;social criterion;private owner;present study;social forestry;religious structure;compensatory afforestation;environmental design;socioeconomic survey;field observation;land use;medical facility;state policy;construction cost;reserved forest;Natural Resources;local condition;noise pollution;environmental auditing;basic amenity;clearance procedure;displaced people;educational institution;occupation pattern;biological resource;physical resources;secondary data;field testing;alternative investment;occupational structure;environmental enhancement;indirect impact;Population Density;construction methodology;construction phase;test result;commercial zone;water sample;garbage dump;dry season;dry period;positive outcome;construction activities;road maintenance;road improvement;noise data;important component;project costing;contract clause;institutional strengthening;engineering consultant;civil engineer;rehabilitation contracts;construction equipment;environmental parameters;archaeological site;surface water;local area;soil erosion;embankment slopes;accident rate;mitigative measure;water resource;reserve forest;wildlife sanctuary;safety measure;religious sites;evaluation impact;plant species;nesting sites;liquid waste;sample collection;domestic effluent;industrial good;study area;cultural property;air monitoring;climatic condition;atmospheric temperature;relative humidity;open well;hand pump;tube wells;Industrial Goods;cultural environment;black soil;drainage system;environmental sensitivity;road pavement;traffic speed;journey time;water monitoring;soil quality;local populace;aesthetic value;civil engineering;positive impact;road work;anthropogenic activity;living creature;policy statement;pollution abatement;environmental pollution;agricultural produce;environmental process;Cultural Heritage;human impact;environment management;public road;road design;natural environment;water bodies;social component;demographic data;environmental features;contract specification;meteorological data;bore well;monitoring stations;legal provision;record keeping;environmental condition;,,,,,

The workshop traversed the diverse and dynamic landscape of PPP investment in infrastructure development with a focus on the East Asia Pacific (EAP) region. It explored the business imperatives and upfront costs in proactive environmental and social risk management, and the subsequent costs and other business risks associated with not following a proactive approach. The workshop examined different perspectives on environmental and social risk management ranging from being part of the development space to mainstreaming it in the private sector. The workshop also considered the role of governments, financers, investors, academia, consultants, civil society, and donors in managing environmental and social risks to support the mobilization of private sector capital into infrastructure investments. The key questions explored by the workshop are covered in this report.","Making Safeguards Work for Investors, Governments and Communities : PPPs for Infrastructure Development in Asia : Workshop Report",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/766781568912979746/pdf/PPPs-for-Infrastructure-Development-in-Asia-Workshop-Report.pdf,/research/2017/01/31170660/making-safeguards-work-investors-governments-communities-ppps-infrastructure-development-asia-workshop-report,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/766781568912979746/PPPs-for-Infrastructure-Development-in-Asia-Workshop-Report,766781568912979746,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/766781568912979746/PPPs-for-Infrastructure-Development-in-Asia-Workshop-Report,D31170660,57,2017/01/31170660/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other Energy and Extractives,Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management,Other Transportation","Other social protection and risk management,Other environment and natural resources management,Environmental policies and institutions","Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management",,,,,,,,,,

The Bank responded to the global economic crisis with speed and volume; as a consequence, its capital headroom is more constrained compared to the pre-crisis level. The shift in International Finance Corporations (IFC's) product mix begun during the crisis will have medium-term implications for its operations. Although most Bank Group country programs meet their objectives, the performance standard set in the World Bank Corporate Scorecard has yet to be attained. Evaluations often find the need to strengthen results frameworks and increase realism of the country program. Among Bank Group operational categories, recent International Evaluation Group (IEG) reports show that support for reforms to expand economic opportunities has been particularly relevant since the economic crisis; there are challenges involved in designing and delivering increasingly complex infrastructure projects; Bank engagement in human development is shifting from increasing access to improving the quality of services; and the integration of environment, social development, and gender issues into the Bank Group's strategic directions and country programs increased. The project outcome ratings for Bank-supported investment projects show a declining trend. Further efforts are needed to improve the quality of monitoring and evaluation and results measurement. The performance of IFC investments was stable overall, but the increasing gap between project performance in International Development Association (IDA) and in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries and the recent decline in the financial sector requires attention. The success of Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) guarantees rests on identifying experienced and financially strong sponsors. IFC and MIGA need to recognize the opportunities and challenges in increasing the concentration of their portfolios in the financial sector. Opportunities for improving Bank project outcome ratings exist in enhancing the effort in preparation and supervision. Given the current uncertainty and the reduced level of IBRD capital headroom, the question of how to calibrate on overall response to crisis and its distribution merits prior thought and preparation. Sustained dialogue and knowledge work will help improve understanding of the issues in client countries. Working across boundaries, including Bank Group internal collaboration, is important. The Bank Group has made significant progress in managing for results; the feedback loop from measuring and assessing results to learning is key. Strengthening the Bank Group's results orientation calls for strong and consistent signals from Bank Group leadership that delivery of results is paramount to lending targets and for alignment of incentives to this effect.",Results and performance of the World Bank Group 2012,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/376171468153850760/pdf/726850BR0R20120Official0Use0Only090.pdf,/projects/documents/2012/08/16750583/results-performance-world-bank-group-2012,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/376171468153850760/Results-and-performance-of-the-World-Bank-Group-2012,376171468153850760,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/376171468153850760/Results-and-performance-of-the-World-Bank-Group-2012,D16750583,203,2012/08/16750583/results-performance-world-bank-group-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preconstruction impacts include investigative surveys, as well as the processes of land acquisition and resettlement. The main impacts to be expected during the construction stage are: land clearing and preparation, movement and operation of heavy construction equipment, the extraction or borrow of local materials for construction, the disposal of spoil, and the concentration of a fairly large construction labor force, many of whom may come from outside the local region. The expected environmental impacts from the power plant will be caused by: gaseous emissions from the chimney liquid effluent and solid wastes from the power plant, housing colony and office facilities.

Natural hazards and extreme weather patterns impose risks on coastal areas that inland areas seldom encounter. North Africa's increasingly populous cities face tangible risks today, but these will be amplified as the impacts of global climate change further manifest themselves over the decades to come. The study, 'climate change adaptation and natural disasters preparedness in the coastal cities of North Africa,' analyzed the exposure of all four locations to natural disasters, such as floods and storm surges, earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as to the increasingly frequent weather extremes associated with climate change. The project, which has taken place from June 2009 to June 2011, has provided tools for evaluating the risks, costing out potential losses, and moving toward specific reforms and investments designed to adapt the cities to a changing climate and increase their resilience to natural hazards.",North Africa coastal cities : address natural disasters and climate change - summary of regional study,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/516161468290697151/pdf/879350WP0Box380imate0Change0Summary.pdf,/research/2011/06/19459850/north-africa-coastal-cities-address-natural-disasters-climate-change-summary-regional-study,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/516161468290697151/North-Africa-coastal-cities-address-natural-disasters-and-climate-change-summary-of-regional-study,516161468290697151,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/516161468290697151/North-Africa-coastal-cities-address-natural-disasters-and-climate-change-summary-of-regional-study,D19459850,28,2011/06/19459850/north-africa-coastal-cities-address-natural-disasters-climate-change-summary-regional-study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The government of Mozambique has adopted the strategic plan for agricultural development (PEDSA 2010-19) that focuses on: (i) increasing the availability of food in order to reduce hunger through growth in small producer productivity and emergency response capacity; (ii) enlarging the land area under sustainable management and the number of reliable water management systems; (iii) increasing access to the market through improved infrastructures and interventions in marketing; and (iv) improving research and extension for increased adoption of appropriate technologies by producers and agro-processors. The World Bank’s agriculture sector risk assessment takes a holistic approach and relies on long time-series historical data to arrive at an empirical and objective assessment of agricultural risks and their impacts on Mozambique. This assessment will form the basis of the second step, solution assessment, whose final findings will inform National Investment Plan for the Agrarian Sector in Mozambique (PNISA). This document considers the many aspects of assessing risk in the Mozambican agriculture sector. Chapter one gives introduction and context. Chapter two introduces the major characteristics of the agricultural system leading into chapter three, which presents a comprehensive picture of the risks that exist in the sector. Chapter four, in quantifying the risks that have been observed, comments on the losses that have been incurred by the sector because of production risks, whereas chapter five provides a qualitative discussion of how risk has an effect on the different stakeholders present in the sector. Chapter six delves into the risk prioritization carried out by the team and then comments on various management measures. The report concludes with chapter six, in which recommendations are provided for improving risk management in Mozambique.",Mozambique - Agricultural sector risk assessment : risk prioritization,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/290851468184466792/pdf/96289-WP-P1143104-Box393200B-PUBLIC-Mozambique-Agric-Sector-Risk-Assessment-WEB-09012015.pdf,/research/2015/08/25022137/mozambique-agricultural-sector-risk-assessment-risk-prioritization,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/290851468184466792/Mozambique-Agricultural-sector-risk-assessment-risk-prioritization,290851468184466792,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/290851468184466792/Mozambique-Agricultural-sector-risk-assessment-risk-prioritization,D25022137,126,2015/09/25022137/mozambique-agricultural-sector-risk-assessment-risk-prioritization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rural policies and institutions,Rural markets,Global food crisis response,Other social protection and risk management","Social protection and risk management,Rural development",,,,Agriculture global practice technical assistance paper,,,,,,

A resettlement plan has been prepared for the households affected. In terms of air quality, the impact of dust during construction will be mitigated by water sprays. Emissions from construction equipment and vehicular transportation will be controlled by reducing vehicular speed. Sulfur Dioxide will be controlled by an 80 percent efficient Flue Gas Desulfurization System (FGD). Major construction activities will be conducted in dry seasons to reduce siltation to the nearby rivers. Water quality affected by suspended solid in the nearby river will be improved by constructing temporary weir to trap sediment. Salt water intrusion into the groundwater will be mitigated by controlling the discharge rate and exploring other water resources. Noise pollution will be minimized by using noise control equipment, creating noise barriers, and publicizing the time for blasting. The threat of thermal pollution to aquatic life will be mitigated by building a water reservoir to reduce water temperature before it is discharged into the river. Wastewater will be pretreated before it is discharged into the water way.

To mitigate environmental adversity due to construction activities, this environmental assessment identifies negative impacts, and sets the framework for the environmental management plan, contained in eight volumes. It includes the legal and policy framework and applicable environmental standards, major potential adverse impacts to the physical and socioeconomic environments in the Project area, analysis of alternatives, and public consultations, in particular, for the Ruijin - Ganzhou expressway, Chogyi County - Fengzhou highway, and, Meicun - Longbu highway. Mitigation measures suggest the following. The project design includes engineering detailed works, i.e., concrete and stone pavements on deep slopes to control soil erosion, and stabilize soil surface, and includes as well interception ditches and landscaping. Borrow pits will be rehabilitated through conversion into ponds, or landscaping following construction. Appropriate drainage systems, retaining walls, and settling ponds will be in place for adequate waste disposal. Sewage disposal facilities will be installed along the construction route in compliance with standard discharge regulations, ensuring water quality through water treatment criteria.

However, there are some concerns about the on-going privatization of Bedouin rangelands, which has the potential to be both inequitable, and a constraint to sustainable range management in a highly spatially, and temporally variable, low rainfall environment. The experience of this project confirms several familiar lessons: Participatory approaches require an initial phase-in period of skills development, and community interaction, even more so if involving women in a highly traditional society. While independent project units aim at immediate implementation benefits in a slow-moving bureaucracy, even bearing the burden of subsequent costs in terms of sustainability (though possibly justified initially in a pilot demonstration), such a pilot however, still leaves the longer-term institutional questions unanswered, with institutional sustainability remaining at the heart of the development process. Notwithstanding, addressing shorter-term welfare, and poverty is an important precondition, ultimately, for addressing longer-term natural resource sustainability.

The first part of the report offers some guidelines on how to conduct a Situation Analysis, which should aim at showing: what are the challenges to the health, and nutrition of school children in a specific country; what is currently being done to improve the health, and nutrition of schoolchildren at the district, or national level; and, what opportunities there are for strengthening this response. Following, a series of actual Situation Analyses is presented, as conducted in very different countries in Francophone, Lusaphone, and Anglophone areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. These cases help illustrate challenges, and opportunities existing in school health, and nutrition programming. They describe some countries with relatively extensive data sources, but also describe those for which information on the health of schoolchildren is almost completely lacking. All cases illustrate that even among the low-income countries of Africa, very different approaches - and levels of effort - may be required to achieve a sufficient level of understanding, to plan an effective school health program.

Some lessons learned included: in complex regional projects, it may be more difficult for the implementation and supervision process to fix design flaws. To increase the likelihood of achieving project objectives, design flaws need to be fixed early in project implementation, at minimum during the Mid-term Review (MTR). The full endorsement and commitment of all the riparian countries of a shared basin is desirable for successful Global Environmental Facility- International Waters (GEF-IW) project implementation, but not necessary if adequate action plans are incorporated in the project design. Country management units' and country offices' increased involvement in project supervision is critical for the regional projects' success. In the absence of a strong regional institution, development assistance should focus on capacity building and institutional strengthening of the recipient, rather than attempting to resolve or bypass the institution's shortcomings by introducing outside agencies for project management and execution. The Bank should be realistic regarding project implementation planning, the time it takes to complete a project of this challenging nature, and the outcome targets to be achieved.",Africa Region - Reversal of Land and Water Degradation Trends in Lake Chad Basin Ecosystem Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/530991468212084221/pdf/ICR11680P070251IC0disclosed08119191.pdf,/projects/documents/2009/06/10975269/africa-region-reversal-land-water-degradation-trends-lake-chad-basin-ecosystem-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/530991468212084221/Africa-Region-Reversal-of-Land-and-Water-Degradation-Trends-in-Lake-Chad-Basin-Ecosystem-Project,530991468212084221,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/530991468212084221/Africa-Region-Reversal-of-Land-and-Water-Degradation-Trends-in-Lake-Chad-Basin-Ecosystem-Project,D10975269,71,2009/06/10975269/africa-region-reversal-land-water-degradation-trends-lake-chad-basin-ecosystem-project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Central Government (Central Agencies),Irrigation and Drainage,Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management","Land administration and management,Water resource management",Environment and natural resource management,,,,,,,,,,

Starting in 2005, Packages began to relocate its paper manufacturing facilities from Lahore (which has limited capacity for expansion), to Kasur. This has allowed the company to increase paper and paperboard production at the new site, while continuing to operate a packaging production plant at Lahore. It is increasingly recognized that a changing climate is creating risks and opportunities for the performance of private sector investments. Recognizing this important knowledge gap, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) commissioned Acclimatise to undertake three pilot studies during 2008 to 2009, based on IFC investments in developing countries. The main aim of these studies was to test and develop methodologies for evaluating climate risks to the private sector and identifying appropriate adaptation responses.

Kariba Urban (i.e. Kariba town) is the official District center and is where the District Administrator (DA) sits along with the District-level offices and staff of the various line ministries. Kariba Urban is situated next to the Lake Kariba dam wall and supports industries and resorts that are founded on the lake’s resources. It is connected to Harare and to Zambia by a well-surfaced tarmac road. Kariba Rural, by contrast, is some 350 km and a 5-hour drive from Kariba Urban and is run by the Nyaminyami Rural District Council (RDC) situated in Siakobvu (see maps overleaf). There is very occasional electricity in Siakobvu and very limited communication infrastructure: limited 2G phone network coverage and poorly maintained earth, gravel, rock road network. In the target area, all of Mola (Ward 3) and the fishing camps, and parts of Negande (Ward 6) and Nebiri (Ward 7) are usually cut off from Siakobvu for 1-2 months of the rainy season, since the bridges across the major rivers have been washed away. Kariba Rural is therefore remote and marginalized. It consists largely of the Matusadona National Park and of legally designated ‘communal lands’ - inhabited primarily by the minority Tonga people who were resettled from the Zambezi River when the Kariba Dam was constructed in 1956. Kariba Rural is categorized by the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) as lying in natural region five and is characterized by low and erratic rainfall and frequent droughts; and by numerous short and high gradient seasonal rivers that feed alluvial soils around the lake edge. Livelihoods are predominantly mixed farming (maize, sorghum & goats), illegal hunting and for the few settlements around the lake shore, fishing. These livelihoods are increasingly threatened by changing hazard and vulnerability profiles, exacerbated by climate variability and climate change. Flash floods commonly destroy bridges and crops planted in and around river beds. Tsetse fly infestations threaten livestock, and wild animals destroy crops as well as putting humans and livestock in danger. There is a high prevalence of malaria, HIV/AIDS and diarrheal disease, with outbreaks of cholera particularly in the fishing camps around the lake shore. Chronic food insecurity is high, with many reliant every year on lean season support. The 2015-16 and 2016-17 agricultural seasons, mirroring much of the rest of Zimbabwe, resulted in significant levels of food insecurity in Kariba Rural: with peak season estimates at 22 percent and 64 percent respectively. Crisis was averted through drought emergency response projects from various actors, including the Red Cross in 2016-17. The communities are also highly vulnerable to, and often exposed to, a variety of different hazards with a high frequency of recurrent ‘small’ disasters which progressively erode any of the small development gains that the communities might have achieved.",Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation into Local Development Planningin Zimbabwe (Vol. 3) : Output 2 : Mainstreaming DRR and CCA into Local Development Plans,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936681559193301146/pdf/Output-2-Mainstreaming-DRR-and-CCA-into-Local-Development-Plans.pdf,/research/2019/05/31108649/mainstreaming-disaster-risk-reduction-climate-change-adaptation-local-development-planningin-zimbabwe-vol-3-output-2-mainstreaming-drr-cca-local-development-plans,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936681559193301146/Output-2-Mainstreaming-DRR-and-CCA-into-Local-Development-Plans,936681559193301146,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/936681559193301146/Output-2-Mainstreaming-DRR-and-CCA-into-Local-Development-Plans,D31108649,131,2019/05/31108649/mainstreaming-disaster-risk-reduction-climate-change-adaptation-local-development-planningin-zimbabwe-vol-3-output-2-mainstreaming-drr-cca-local-development-plans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Public Administration - Water, Sanitation and Waste Management,Other Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management,Other Transportation,Other Public Administration,Sub-National Government",Natural disaster management,Social protection and risk management,Sub-Saharan Africa,World,Southern Africa,,,,,,,

Some lessons learned included: a combination of watershed and livelihoods interventions can create strong multiplication effects. A balance is needed between community desires for soil and water conservation investments, and technically effective and rational treatments. This was demonstrated under the project's experience through the participatory planning system, supported by training and intensive process monitoring, quality controls, cost ceilings, and beneficiary contribution rates that promoted equity. The equity and poverty reduction aims and processes within watershed development need clear articulation. An independent and credible partner monitoring and evaluation (M&E) institution can complement M&E functions in the implementing agency and provide major contributions to project success. The project showed a strong need to ensure that Income Generating Activity (IGAs) and Self-Help Group (SHGs) get adequate follow-up advice and linkage building to achieve longer term sustainability.",India - Karnataka Watershed Development Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/285681468284123189/pdf/ICR12050P0672110disclosed0101151091.pdf,/projects/documents/2009/09/11217839/india-karnataka-watershed-development-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/285681468284123189/India-Karnataka-Watershed-Development-Project,285681468284123189,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/285681468284123189/India-Karnataka-Watershed-Development-Project,D11217839,85,2009/09/11217839/india-karnataka-watershed-development-project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agricultural Extension, Research, and Other Support Activities,Sub-National Government,Other social services,Other industry,Other Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry","Environmental policies and institutions,Water resource management,Rural non-farm income generation,Participation and civic engagement","Social dev/gender/inclusion,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management",World,Asia,South Asia,,,,,,,

The impact of these shocks has been far reaching, and the resulting macroeconomic instability has been a major constraint to growth and poverty reduction in Malawi. This paper describes a weather risk management tool that has been developed to help the government manage the financial impact of drought-related national maize production shortfalls. The instrument is an index-based weather derivative contract designed to transfer the financial risk of severe and catastrophic national drought that adversely impacts the government's budget to the international risk markets. Because rainfall and maize yields are highly correlated, changes in rainfall -- its timing, cumulative amount, and distribution -- can act as an accurate proxy for maize losses. An index has been constructed using rainfall data from 23 weather stations throughout Malawi and uses daily rainfall as an input to predict maize yields and therefore production throughout the country. The index picks up the well documented historical drought events in 2005, 1995, 1994, and 1992 and a weather derivative contract based on such an index would have triggered timely cash payouts to the government in those years. This innovative risk management instrument was pioneered in 2008/2009 by the Government of Malawi, with the assistance of the World Bank, and was a first for a sovereign entity in Africa. Several piloting seasons will be necessary to understand the scope and limitations of such contracts, and their role in the government's strategy, contingency planning, and operational drought response framework.",National drought insurance for Malawi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/930811468271571483/pdf/WPS5169.pdf,/research/2010/01/11634487/national-drought-insurance-malawi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/930811468271571483/National-drought-insurance-for-Malawi,930811468271571483,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/930811468271571483/National-drought-insurance-for-Malawi,D11634487,22,2010/01/11634487/National-drought-insurance-for-Malawi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Southern Africa,Sub-Saharan Africa,World,Policy Research working paper ; no.

Nevertheless, the performance of the Bank was marginally satisfactory, for although considerable flexibility was given during implementation, supervision was negligent due to the lack of appropriate procurement planning, and transparency in the selection process. Similarly, the performance of the Borrower gave mixed results, particularly, due to the untimely release of counterpart funds, and, delays during implementation because of late budgetary, and project approvals. The lessons convey primarily, the importance of beneficiary participation in both the design, and implementation stages of projects, to enhance project ownership, and increase loan repayment. This flexibility allows the inclusion of beneficiaries' suggestions, - as in this case - on appropriate usage, and location of pumps, which proved successful for water availability. Private sector involvement can greatly improve project sustainability, as will, that from non-governmental organizations, and local governments, if agreed early on, ensuring greater commitment. It is further suggested, that project design should consider downstream linkages, such as storage, processing and marketing of agricultural products, much more comprehensively, to attain the agricultural development expected.",Nigeria - National Fadama Development Project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/903771468332422866/pdf/multi-page.pdf,/projects/documents/2000/01/728699/nigeria-national-fadama-development-project,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/903771468332422866/Nigeria-National-Fadama-Development-Project,903771468332422866,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/903771468332422866/Nigeria-National-Fadama-Development-Project,D728699,87,2000/01/728699/Nigeria-National-Fadama-Development-Project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Water Supply,Central Government (Central Agencies),Roads and highways",,,World,Sub-Saharan Africa,West Africa,,farmer;Monitoring and Evaluation Unit;Strategy for Agriculture;Policy and Institutional Framework;Work Program and Budget;data collection and analysis;Economic Rate of Retum;Environmental and Social Impact;lack of transparency;agricultural growth rate;construction of wells;cost recovery program;Full Environmental Assessment;child in school;water user association;basic food commodity;concept of land;sense of ownership;bank for review;average cropping intensity;provision of equipment;water for irrigation;cost of land;poor cost recovery;weights and measure;effect of inflation;population growth rate;water irrigation;procurement filing system;water user group;bank supervision missions;underground water resource;private sector support;access road construction;disease control measure;agricultural extension service;transfer of ownership;increase in technology;crop yield increase;commercial bank loan;irrigation management;counterpart fund;procurement operation;contract management;project costing;eligibility criterion;farmer organization;small-scale irrigation;borrower performance;irrigation technologies;surface water;rainfall regime;dry season;procurement audit;poverty alleviation;agricultural production;shallow groundwater;escrow account;rice paddy;Vegetable Production;counterpart funding;irish potato;operational plan;government control;main canals;project sustainability;cadastral survey;hydrological station;aide memoire;federal agency;agreed provision;storage facility;marketing facility;basal rot;procurement process;borrower's performance;Conflict Resolution;initial deposit;fruit tree;Agricultural Technology;meteorological stations;observation well;water sample;commercial lending;crop area;financial return;procurement contract;loan repayment;family nutrition;contract packaging;aggregate limits;procurement schedule;infrastructural facility;irrigation pump;beneficiary participation;baseline survey;loan package;formal loan;loan proceeds;loan extension;local industry;record keeping;government support;contractual condition;technology development;adaptive research;improved technologies;contract implementation;groundwater resource;community for use;federal officials;banking operation;savings mobilization;credit agency;beneficiary involvement;average price;budgetary resource;staff capacity;aquifer levels;downstream activity;input use;field visits;farm income;cross river;adequate arrangement;contractual payment;Water Management;computer data;negative effect;pay contract;procurement system;soil management;borrower supervision;socioeconomic impact;loan period;stock water;yield reduction;middle belt;crop disease;technology support;process plant;veterinary service;veterinary Services;loan recovery;local farmer;flood control;herd owner;farm productivity;stock route;monitoring arrangement;statistical table;sugar mill;credit disbursement;remedial measure;baseline study;project operation;environmental monitoring;trained farmer;foreign exchange;wheat production;grazing reserve;diversification strategy;foreign costs;loan disbursement;small-scale farmer;eligible state;evaporative cooling;land title;complementary activities;public resource;executive committees;farmer participation;interest group;unit price;flood plain;farm input;technology adoption;crop production;gainful employment;young men;loan fund;rural-urban migration;project financing;federal level;irrigation engineers;federal government;monitoring data;upland area;environmental degradation;federal funding;market problem;crop diversification;farm level;investment cost;international fund;water charge;high achievement;irrigation development;direct intervention;production credit;inorganic fertilizer;environmental sustainability;mitigation measure;fertilizer distribution;environmental front;supply contract;state agency;institution development;irrigation investment;study including;road provision;community social;downstream activities;satisfactory progress;,,,,,

Climate change jeopardizes agricultural production and food security at a time when the world is working to achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to ‘end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.’ At the same time, agriculture and other land-use sectors are one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. This gender gap means that when it comes to developing and adopting CSA practices, men and women are not starting at the same point. To succeed, CSA practices depend on institutional and behavioral changes that are not possible to achieve without first analyzing the social and gender issues influencing policies, projects, and other interventions aimed at achieving sustainable CSA. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that more equal gender relations within households and communities lead to better agricultural and development outcomes, including increases in farm productivity and improvements in family nutrition. There is now an international consensus that the design and implementation of climate change response strategies and projects must consider gender-specific differences in the capacity to adapt to and mitigate climate change.",How to integrate gender issues in climate-smart agriculture projects : training module,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796051506956770476/pdf/FAO-WB-Gender-in-CSA-Training-Module.pdf,/research/2017/10/28021802/integrate-gender-issues-climate-smart-agriculture-projects-training-module,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796051506956770476/How-to-integrate-gender-issues-in-climate-smart-agriculture-projects-training-module,796051506956770476,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/796051506956770476/How-to-integrate-gender-issues-in-climate-smart-agriculture-projects-training-module,D28021802,72,2017/10/28021802/integrate-gender-issues-climate-smart-agriculture-projects-training-module,"Taivalmaa,Sanna Liisa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall World Bank performance was satisfactory as was Borrower performance. Some of the lessons learned focus on the following: Long-term sustainability can be enhanced through building regional and national commitment, and institutional and technical capacity ensure national buy-in. Also on the institutional front, the project illustrates the need for a flexible approach. The best option for the region seems to be to develop a regional core capacity that brigns together the limited national institutional assets for work on climate change issues. Political buy-in can be enhanced through a highly visible regional coordination institution, multi-stakeholder committee, public awareness campaigns, and involvement of a variety of relevant national ministries, as well as promoted by developing economic instruments and incentives. The use of SDR-denominated GEF grants introduces a currency risk that needs to be taken into account by building contingency funds in the financing plan. These risks should be considered upfront in project preparation and monitored throughout implementation. Complex projects that require flexible implementation may necessitate conservative schedules and cost contingencies. Careful assessment of structure, functions, administrative processes, and realistic scheduling is needed when establishing new institutions.

Applicable pollutant discharge standards can be met and extent and scope of environmental impact by pollutant discharge will be insignificant. However, there will be potential negative impacts mainly associated with closure of the existing dump site and site clean-up of limited coal mining wastes. During construction phase, there will be general construction-related impacts such as disposal of sediments and waste generated from demolished buildings, nuisance of dust, noise, wastewater, and disturbance to the local communities etc. In the operation phase, adverse impacts mainly include, among others, disposal of leachate and methane gas collected from the dump site. Potential negative impacts may also be related to future land use of the area after rehabilitation.

The project will ensure a minimum navigable water depth during dry seasons, thus guaranteeing an uninterrupted flow of shipping and the reclassification of the river to a third class waterway accessible to 1000 ton barges. The anticipated environmental impacts assessed by this study are as follows. Location issues include: 1) inundation management and prevention; 2) socio-economic impacts; 3) flora and fauna; and 4) impact on cultural and historical properties. Construction issues include: 1) noise; 2) soil erosion and dust; 3) atmospheric pollution; 4) surface water pollution; 5) economic impacts of construction; and 6) public health. The principle impacts on the environment include disruption of areas adjacent to the project site, soil erosion, temporary water quality decline, and air quality degradation resulting from the construction process. Impacts to terrestrial and aquatic resources appear to be minimal since the project will be located on a highly regulated waterway and will not create significantly new conditions. Potential impacts may occur due to the large labor population which the project will attract and thirteen cultural and historic sites will be affected by inundation, necessitating protection measures and excavation in some cases.",China - Guigang Multi-Purpose Navigation Project : summary environmental impact assessment : Summary EIA : Guangxi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425731468019139173/pdf/multi-page.pdf,/projects/documents/1994/04/698473/china-guigang-multi-purpose-navigation-project-summary-environmental-impact-assessment-summary-eia-guangxi,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425731468019139173/Summary-EIA-Guangxi,425731468019139173,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425731468019139173/Summary-EIA-Guangxi,D698473,28,1994/04/698473/Summary-EIA-Guangxi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ports/Waterways,Sub-National Government","Infrastructure services for private sector development,Rural non-farm income generation","Financial and private sector development,Rural development",World,East Asia and Pacific,Asia,"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2",Waterways; Environmental impact assessment; Socioeconomic conditions; Flora; Fauna; Noise pollution; Soil erosion; Dust; Air pollution; Water pollution; Public health; Water quality; Air quality; Historic sites & monuments; Floods; Rivers; Organizational structure; Financial policy; Market economy; Navigation; Dams; Transport; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Economic development; Inland waterways; Poverty mitigation; Labor markets; Policy reform,,,,,

Farm net revenue were regressed against climate, soil, socioeconomic and hydrological variables to determine which factors influence the variability of farm net revenues. 900 households from 20 governorates were interviewed. The standard Ricardian model was applied, in addition to three other models, each representing an adaptation option that could be used to reduce the harmful effects of temperature stress. A further adaptation strategy was tested: raising livestock on the farm to cope with the harmful effects of climate change. Besides this, the effects of two climate change scenarios (using MAGICC/SCENGEN and GCMs-General Circulation Models) were considered. The results from the two climate change scenarios showed that high temperatures will constrain agricultural production in Egypt. Irrigation and technology are therefore the recommended adaptation options. However, warming may also affect water resources and that would pose another problem for agricultural production. A policy should be developed to cope with the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture. It should focus on three areas: crop management, water management, and land management. The favored option for adapting to increased temperatures is irrigation. Some farmers adjust their crop sowing dates to avoid the expected high temperatures. To adjust to shortages in rainfall, farmers use crop varieties with high water use efficiency and early maturing varieties.",Assessing the economic impacts of climate change on agriculture in Egypt : a ricardian approach,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/690661468234308557/pdf/wps4293.pdf,/research/2007/07/8005836/assessing-economic-impacts-climate-change-agriculture-egypt-ricardian-approach,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/690661468234308557/Assessing-the-economic-impacts-of-climate-change-on-agriculture-in-Egypt-a-ricardian-approach,690661468234308557,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/690661468234308557/Assessing-the-economic-impacts-of-climate-change-on-agriculture-in-Egypt-a-ricardian-approach,D8005836,39,2007/07/8005836/assessing-economic-impacts-climate-change-agriculture-egypt-ricardian-approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,World,"Europe, Middle East and North Africa",Middle East and North Africa,Policy Research working paper ; no.

The objectives will be achieved through the rehabilitation, improvement, and expansion of water supply systems and sewage; and improving the treatment and disposal of wastewater as well as enhancing overall management of the water sector. The projects negative impacts are the following: noise generation, impact on water quality and resources, impact on water by run-offs from construction disposal of water treatment sludge, protection of air quality from the construction dust, and possibly results of removal or relocation of trees and vegetation. The project mitigation measures include: (1) no construction at night using heavy machinery near residential areas; (2) no discretionary use of noisy machinery; (3) good maintenance and proper operation of construction machinery; (4) installation of temporary sound barriers if necessary; and (5) avoiding large vehicle transport through residential areas.",Moldova - National Water Supply and Sanitation Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 2) : Environmental assessment for selected towns,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/519211468273909264/pdf/E18230v20Repla1FINAL1051031081vol11.pdf,/projects/documents/2008/03/9078628/moldova-national-water-supply-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-environmental-assessment-selected-towns,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/519211468273909264/Environmental-assessment-for-selected-towns,519211468273909264,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/519211468273909264/Environmental-assessment-for-selected-towns,D9078628,188,2008/03/9078628/Environmental-assessment-for-selected-towns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sewerage,Water Supply","Health system performance,Water resource management,Pollution management and environmental health,Other rural development,Infrastructure services for private sector development","Human development,Financial and private sector development,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management",World,Commonwealth of Independent States,Eastern Europe,,,Europe,,,,
