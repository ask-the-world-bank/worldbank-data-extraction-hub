  1. Overview of Recent Developments
 Egypt is making historic headway against Hepatitis C, one of its most insidious
killers. In 2016, roughly 40,000 Egyptians died of the disease, and nearly 4.5-
5 million are currently infected—the highest burden in the world for Egypt’s
population size.(1) But the landscape has changed dramatically in the past few
years. Following successful negotiations between the Egyptian government and
drug makers in 2014, breakthrough medications known as direct-acting antiviral
agents (DAAs) have become widely available at markedly reduced prices.
  Since then, more than a million Egyptians have been treated, with a cure
rate exceeding 95% in many settings.(2) Such rapid progress has brought Egypt
growing international attention, with some predicting that Egypt’s approach
might serve as a model for other low and middle-income nations facing similarly
large Hepatitis C burdens. In addition to lowering the cost of drugs, Egypt has
succeeded in opening new treatment centers, creating electronic portals to enroll
patients, and expanding its domestic pharmaceutical industry to ensure a steady
pipeline of affordable medications.
 These commitments, in turn, have raised political stakes inside Egypt and
encouraged even more ambitious targets: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-
Sisi, in a series of high-profile speeches and statements over the past two years,
has spoken frequently of his dream to rid the country of the disease.
  Yet Egypt faces significant challenges toward meeting this ambitious goal. The
fact that one million people were treated so quickly reflects, to a large degree,
pent up demand: For years, Egyptians diagnosed with Hepatitis C had no good
treatment options, so when effective medications finally became available, many
rushed to get treatment.


(1) Estimates of the prevalence of Hepatitis C in Egypt vary by data set, year, and methodology.
The figure quoted here reflects findings by the Ministry of Health and Population (2015), Waked
et al (2014), and the Bank’s own modelling, adjusted for recent trends.

somewhat based upon treatment regimen and underlying patient characteristics, e.g. presence of
cirrhosis, history of prior treatment failure, etc.

  The situation today looks quite different for the millions who still need treatment,
as most have yet to be diagnosed and are unlikely to seek treatment on their own.
As a result, Egypt faces pressure to take a more proactive approach to finding
infected individuals—through screening programs and other measures—to
ensure that the program’s early momentum continues.
  Beginning in 2015, the World Bank began collaborating with the Egyptian
government to provide technical advice on the country’s efforts to eliminate
Hepatitis C. This work builds upon the country’s National Viral Hepatitis Plan of
Action, which outlined a series of strategic goals and policies for eliminating the
disease. While offering a strong foundation, the plan lacked specific projections
on the cost and impact of various policy choices over the short and long-term
that policymakers would need to plan their response. To address those gaps, over
the past year, the Bank, in close coordination with the government and other
stakeholders, has undertaken a series of policy analyses and economic modelling
exercises, the results of which are summarized and updated here.
  The Bank’s findings sketch out a series of strategies and actions that could
inform Egypt’s drive toward eliminating Hepatitis C. They provide estimates of
funding commitments that may be needed to make the vision of a Hepatitis C-free
Egypt a reality, and offer a realistic timeline for carrying out such efforts given
existing constraints. With appropriate resources, strategies, and continued policy
leadership, Egypt can build upon recent progress and maintain its momentum
toward eliminating this disease.

                                   2. Background:
            Assessing the Burden of Hepatitis C in Egypt
  Egypt has the highest burden of Hepatitis C in the world. As of 2015, roughly
7% of the Egyptian adult population (age 15-59) was infected.(3) Many of these
infections, unfortunately, occurred in the 1960-1980s as part of a nationwide
campaign to eradicate schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm found in the Nile River
that can cause organ failure and cancer if left untreated; as part of that campaign,
more than 6 million people were treated with injectable therapies, often with
reused and inadequately sterilized glass needles.(4) As a result, Hepatitis C, which
was not discovered until the late 1980s, spread rapidly through the population.
The disease burden today reflects this legacy: More than one in the five Egyptians
age 50-59 are a carrier of Hepatitis C, compared to less than 1% of children and
teenagers (figure 1). The disease is also much more common among Egyptians
who are poor and rural-dwelling, particularly those living in the Delta (figure 1).

  Yet Hepatitis C is not just a problem of historical infections, as nearly 150,000
Egyptians were estimated to have been newly infected in 2016 alone. The rate
of new infections—also thought to be the highest in the world—reflects both
the large reservoir of people carrying the disease as well as the continued role
of unsafe medical practices, which increase the risk of transmission. Efforts to
improve blood safety at blood banks and to implement stronger infection control
policies in hospitals and other health settings are underway, but significant work
remains.
  The direct health impacts of Hepatitis C in Egypt are immense. Hepatitis C is a
chronic, often dormant infection, with most individuals living asymptomatically
for decades before developing complications. These complications, unfortunately,
are becoming increasingly common as Egypt’s infected population ages. Roughly
40,000 Egyptians will die of Hepatitis C-related complications this year—35,000
from liver failure, another 5,000 from liver cancer—making it Egypt’s third-
leading cause of death, trailing only cardiovascular disease and stroke (figure 2).(5)
 A fraction of patients will be eligible for a liver transplant, but given how
costly and resource-intensive transplantation can be, few will receive
one; only 400-500 liver transplants are performed in Egypt every year.(6)
 Meanwhile, the percentage of Egyptians dying from Hepatitis C has steadily
increased over the years. Today, 9.1% of all deaths among Egyptian males
are related to Hepatitis C, up from 5.8% in 1990; among women, the number
has also risen, from 4.4 to 5.6% over the same time period (figure 2).(7)

  The budget impacts are equally large. Given the size of its infected
population, Egypt is already spending hundreds of millions of dollars a
year on Hepatitis C, mostly on late-stage complications. In 2017, the Bank’s
modelling shows that Egypt is expected to spend an estimated $463 million
on Hepatitis C, nearly half of which ($230 million) will be on the late-
stage liver failure (decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplants) or cancer.(8)
 Based upon these projections, if Egypt continues on its current treatment path,
it will spend nearly $4 billion on Hepatitis C by 2030 (figure 3). These costs
reflect direct health spending only. When one takes into account the economic
productivity lost due to premature deaths from Hepatitis C, estimates suggest
that Egypt in 2015 lost nearly $1 billion in GDP alone.(9)




(8)  Spending estimates are based on a policy scenario that assumes 5% of the adult population
is screened annually, in addition to demand-driven treatment. See section 4 of this brief for

  3. Tackling the Challenge:
 Political and Policy Leadership
  Efforts to address to Hepatitis C in Egypt have been building for years, but the
Egyptian government opened a remarkable new front against the disease in 2014,
when it successfully negotiated with Gilead Sciences, a U.S.-based drug maker,
to make the company’s new Hepatitis C treatment available in Egypt at greatly
reduced prices. The drug, Sofosbuvir, was approved in the United States in 2013
with cure rates exceeding 90%, representing a major advance over previous
interferon-based therapy, which was costly and worked for only about half of the
patients who took it. But Sofosbuvir’s price tag was high: more than $80,000 for
a 12-week curative course. Egypt, following negotiations with Gilead, was able
to secure the drug for only $900, a deal that opened up the possibility of treating
infected Egyptians in large numbers.(10)
  Since those initial negotiations, the government of Egypt has taken major steps
to get medications into the hands of patients (figure 4). Building upon the Viral
Hepatitis Plan of Action, the government opened 56 new treatment centers by 2016,
with plans to reach 100 in total. It developed a web-based registration system that
allows Egyptians to enroll for testing and, if needed, receive treatment. In an effort
to reduce drug prices even further, the government has supported the development
of the domestic pharmaceutical industry. More than a dozen Egyptian companies
are now licensed to manufacture DAAs, leading to further drops in prices. The
three-month course (of select regimens) now costs less than $100, and apart from
a $2 user fee charged at the treatment centers, the medicines are provided free of
charge for any Egyptian seeking treatment in public facilities.(11)

  Although more than a million Egyptians have now been treated under the new
program, recent reports suggest the momentum may be slowing. When DAAs
became widely available in Egypt, in 2015, most Egyptians diagnosed with
Hepatitis C rushed to get treated. Demand was so great that many treatment
centers were overwhelmed by long wait times and hundreds of patients a day
seeking treatment. By the end of 2016, however, these wait times had largely
resolved; most patients who wanted treatment had received it. Yet according
to estimates, 4-5 million Egyptians still carry the disease and have yet to seek
treatment, likely because they do not know they are infected.
  To ensure infected individuals continue to receive treatment, Egypt is beginning
to scale up efforts to implement screening programs, which will be critical for
eliminating the disease within desired time frames. Working with the World
Bank, authorities in early 2017 carried out a Hepatitis C pilot screening program
in the Upper Nile region, using teams of community health workers traveling
through villages to screen for the virus. In three months, more than 1 million
people were tested, suggesting that screening large numbers in relatively short
time periods is feasible if screening programs are implemented in a strategic and
well-planned manner. Additional screening activities are now underway in Cairo.
 Today, Egypt stands poised to continue its march toward eliminating Hepatitis
C, but critical decisions must be made about the direction of the program.


 10
Although current approaches will continue to have a major public health impact,
expanding screening over the next several years could greatly accelerate progress
toward a Hepatitis C-free Egypt and rapidly cut new infection rates and the
number of chronic carriers. Yet such a bold course of action will also require
greater up-front investments, as a national screening program and supportive
measures will demand greater initial spending to save more lives (and potentially
money) and reduce future suffering.
  The following sections summarize a series of in-depth reports produced by
the World Bank to assist Egyptian authorities as they weigh their options. The
reports are intended to help policymakers make informed decisions about the
potential impacts and costs of various approaches as they move forward on the
national effort to eliminate Hepatitis C from Egypt.

  4. Choosing the Best Path Forward:
 Updated Economic & Impact Assessments
  Since 2015, the World Bank has been engaged with the Egyptian government to
unlock the potential of its Viral Plan of Action. As part of its technical assistance,
the Bank has carried out multiple in-depth studies of Egypt’s Hepatitis C program,
analyzing epidemiological, policy, economic, and fiscal data to help authorities
prioritize their actions as they seek to eliminate the disease. These studies have
included:
  ■ A costing study of the various components of the national Viral Plan
  of Action, focusing on the costs of various treatment, care, and prevention
  strategies
  ■ Cost-effectiveness analyses of treatment and screening scenarios to identify
  the relative costs and benefits of each
  ■ Economic analyses of targeted prevention strategies, including improving
  blood safety and infection control
  To establish a solid foundation for this work, in 2016, the Bank, working closely
with Egyptian stakeholders and the World Health Organization, conducted
a costing exercise of the different components of Egypt’s Plan of Action for
eliminating Hepatitis C. Participants reviewed efforts undertaken by other
countries to determine the cost of similar programs; collected cost information
in Egypt based upon market rates; and convened workshops involving a wide
spectrum of stakeholders (World Bank, WHO, Ministry of Health, and other
academic and civil society technical and clinical experts) to produce consensus
findings.
  Building upon this work, the World Bank modelled multiple treatment
and screening scenarios, examining the costs and impacts (number treated,
reduction in chronic carriers, rate of new infections, and deaths averted) of each.
Five scenarios were initially modelled; please see World Bank (2017), Burden &
Response: An Economic Analysis, for more details. A subset of these scenarios
are briefly described in Table 1 below, along with an additional scenario, labeled



 12
“Current Path,” which reflects the Bank’s best estimate of current policies in
Egypt given the rapidly changing landscape for screening and treatment. This
updated scenario aims to capture these late-breaking developments, while also
demonstrating the model’s ability to adapt to evolving conditions and policies.

               Table 1: Description of Modelled Policy Scenarios

        Scenario                              Description
                          This scenario models what would happen if
                          demand-driven treatment policies were continued
     Treatment Only
                          but no efforts were made to implement or scale up
                          screening.
                          This scenario reflects the Bank’s best estimate of
                          what is happening in Egypt today. With screening
  “CURRENT PATH”          activities beginning in the first half of 2017, the
   (5% Screening and      Bank projects that Egypt might be able to screen
      Treatment)          up to 5% of the adult population this year (and
                          in subsequent years), in addition to continuing
                          demand-drive treatment.
                          Under this scenario, 10% of the adult population
                          would be screened annually beginning in 2017, and
     10% Screening
                          all individuals who screen positive would receive
    (and Treatment)
                          treatment in addition to those who seek treatment
                          on their own.

                          This scenario aims to demonstrate what would be
                          required to eliminate Hepatitis C from Egypt in
                          an accelerated but realistic manner given existing
                          constraints. Under this scenario, 10% of the adult
                          population would be screened in 2017; screening
       Elimination
                          would be scaled up to 20% of the adult population
                          from 2018-2021, with the remainder screened
                          in 2022. As with the previous scenario, all who
                          screen positive will be treated with appropriate
                          medications.



                                                                            13
  Although continuing current policies (“Current Path” scenario) or modestly
scaling up treatment (10% screening scenario) will have major public health
benefits, both approaches will fall short of timely elimination. As shown in Table
2 below, the model predicts that continuing current treatment policies (“current
path”) will treat 2.5 million people and reduce the number of chronically infected
and new annual infections by roughly 50 percent by 2023. These accomplishments
would be laudable, but they would still leave 2.3 million people carrying the
disease by 2023, falling well short of elimination. Scaling up screening moderately,
as depicted in 10% screening scenario, would also fall short of elimination in the
short-to-medium term, but it would get Egypt further towards its goal. Under
this approach, 3.1 million people would receive treatment by 2023, chronic
infections would be reduced by 60 percent, and new infection rates cut by 65
percent, while an additional 23,000 deaths would be averted by 2030 compared
to current policies.

  Eliminating Hepatitis C in a more rapid manner will require a substantial scale
up in screening, as depicted in the model’s more aggressive elimination scenario.
According to the model, Egypt would treat approximately 4.5 million people by
2023 under the elimination scenario—nearly 2 million more than what could
be expected under a 5% annual screening policy (Figure 5). Additionally, the
Bank estimates that the number of chronic carriers and the rate of new infections
would fall more than 90% from current levels by 2023, a much greater drop
than predicted under other scenarios. The results also predict that nearly 72,000
deaths from Hepatitis C will be avoided by 2030 compared to continuing current
policies.

  Scaling up screening will require greater short-term spending, however. If Egypt
were to continue on its current path, it would spend an estimated $463 million on
Hepatitis C in 2017, and roughly $2.5 billion by 2023. By comparison, pursuing
elimination will cost an additional $530 million through 2022, as shown in the
shaded red in figure 6 below. These additional costs largely reflect the added
costs of testing (currently estimated at $6 per person for the initial antibody
screening test and $67 per person for the confirmatory RNA test), as well as the
costs of treating positive cases with new DAA therapies. (Alternatively, scaling
up screening more modestly, to 10% of the adult population annually, would cost
an extra $348 million through 2021, but also treat fewer people, as shown above.)

  From 2023 onward, the spending picture changes dramatically, as elimination
becomes cost-saving relative to current policies. On an annual basis, elimination
becomes the least costly scenario by 2023, as the number of patients needing
testing and treatment decreases (as most have been tested and treated), and
spending on late-stage complications falls. From 2023-2030, Egypt is projected to
spend approximately $60 million less every year on Hepatitis C-related care and
treatment under elimination than current policies (green area in figure 6). These


 16
savings nearly recoup the entire initial investment by the end of the decade. More
detailed analyses of the relative costs of other scenarios, and the cost-effectiveness
in terms of costs per infection and death averted, are provided in the full report.
Needless to say, all screening and elimination approaches are considered cost-
effective by standard definitions, and even more so for older age groups, among
whom infection is much more common.
  Targeted prevention strategies also provide excellent returns on investment.
Because most new Hepatitis C infections in Egypt are caused by unsafe medical
or hygiene practices, certain individuals are at much higher risk, including those
frequently in hospitals or around blood, such as dialysis patients, healthcare
workers, and patients who need repeat blood transfusions. Using best available
data, the Bank examined three targeted prevention strategies—training health
workers with safety engineered devices, supplying blood banks with modern
analysis tools, and implementing infection control policies for dialysis patients—
and found that all three strategies are highly cost-effective. For every $1 spent,
safety training for health workers provides a return on investment of more than
$12; updating blood banks, nearly $1.70; and implementing infection control
policies, nearly $1.38.(12) More details can be found in the full report.

  5. Monitoring the Progress
  Although the advent of new medications has raised the hopes of a cure for millions
of Egyptians, eliminating Hepatitis C will require more than just treatment; it
also demands careful monitoring and coordination of program activities. As the
diagram below illustrates, the process of getting someone tested and treated—and
repeating that sequence for millions—is a multi-step undertaking, not only for
the patient but also for the agencies required to coordinate that effort. Egypt has
made some strides on this front, for example, creating a web-based registration
portal to enroll Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) patients for testing
and treatment, and working to empower the Viral Hepatitis Administration
(VHA), which has been tasked with overseeing various activities related to the
elimination campaign.

  Yet current coordination and monitoring efforts remain underdeveloped.(13)
Healthcare delivery in Egypt is highly fragmented, and a variety of agencies,
including the MOHP, quasi-government affiliated hospitals, university facilities,
private hospitals, and NGO-run facilities, currently offer their own screening and
treatment services. To the Bank’s knowledge, these institutions do not have an
established system for communicating with one another, nor do they report their
activities and results to a common agency. As a result, information about the
number of people being tested, treated, or cured is not being adequately captured,
and opportunities for identifying and fixing problems, not to mention tracking
progress towards elimination, are likely being missed (figure 8).

  As part of its assistance, the Bank formally assessed the VHA’s capacity to
carry out monitoring and evaluation activities critical for the program’s success.
Through interviews with key informants and a detailed mapping of how various
actors communicate with one another, key gaps were identified that could
threaten the program’s long-term success and overall credibility of its findings.(14)
These include the following:
■ Critical gaps in reporting and documentation. Although the MOHP’s web-
based portal allows it to track patients, other entities carrying out screening and
treatment do not participate in a unified reporting system, making monitoring
and evaluation difficult and limiting opportunities for corrective action.
■ Limited oversight and coordination of prevention efforts. Egypt’s system
of blood banking, for example, is also highly fragmented. The National Blood
Transfusion Service oversees 30% of the country’s blood banks, with the remainder
falling under the jurisdiction of other public and private hospital banks (or other
entities). There is currently no single entity responsible for collecting information
and enforcing standards for all of the country’s banks. Likewise, although the
VHA oversees infection control for MOHP hospitals, non-MOHP hospitals
report to their own infection control departments—and rarely to the VHA.
  Given these findings and the critical importance of having strong monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms in place to ensure the program’s success, the Bank
developed several recommendations for strengthening coordination and
reporting. These include:
■ Developing a national screening program under the Viral Hepatitis Administration
to coordinate and standardize all screening activities and ensure that positive
cases are referred for treatment.
■ Establishing a unified reporting system under the VHA, which would collect
data on a regular basis from all treatment centers on the number of cases screened,
treated, and cured.

■ Establishing a National Blood Authority to ensure the quality and safety of the
blood supply and enforce reporting of all positive cases.

■ Standardizing infection control policies for all hospitals and regulating these
activities under a single inspection/auditing entity.

■ Developing key performance indicators to closely monitor progress and allow
corrective action if certain elements of the program fall short of targets.

  Conclusion
  Egypt today is at a critical juncture for addressing Hepatitis C. In the span of
just a few years, it has treated more than a million patients and seriously raised the
possibility of eliminating the disease within a time frame of years rather than decades.
Political support has rallied behind these efforts, and international attention is high.
  As this updated report outlines, to maintain its momentum, Egypt could consider
expanding the scope of its treatment program to include a national screening
effort that would draw new patients into the pipeline. Without screening, the
number of patients receiving treatment will likely fall and significantly delay the
prospects of elimination. Scaling up screening could help treat nearly 2 million
more patients and rapidly cut the number of carriers and new infections, while
averting tens of thousands of additional deaths by 2030.
  More ambitious efforts will require additional spending initially, but the costs of
inaction will be increasingly burdensome. Egypt is already spending in excess of $450
million (US$) a year on Hepatitis C related costs, mostly on treatments for liver failure
and other end-stage complications. An investment of $530 million (US$) from 2017-
2022 is projected to place Egypt on the path toward elimination while decreasing
annual spending on Hepatitis C thereafter, nearly paying itself off by the end of the
next decade. All screening scenarios modelled by the Bank are cost-effective by
standard definitions, and several pilot screening programs are already underway.
  As Egypt pushes to screen and treat millions of patients, it will also need to
enhance its ability to monitor and evaluate its efforts, as well as to strengthen
prevention activities. To build M&E capacity, it should consider empowering the
Viral Hepatitis Administration (VHA) such that all treatment centers—whether
government, private, NGO-run, or other—regularly report their activities to
the VHA. Additional policies and capacity building are needed to strengthen
reporting systems, safety measures, and quality oversight.
  With sound policies, continued leadership, appropriate financial commitments,
and a serious commitment to monitoring and evaluation, Egypt can continue
on the path toward eliminating Hepatitis C. This would be a remarkable
accomplishment in itself—and provide a global public good by pointing the way
forward for other countries. percent discount. Reuters, March 21, 2014.
